But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people.</span> <span class="sentence">I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years.</span> <span class="sentence">During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.</span> <span class="sentence">I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.</span> <span class="sentence">Former UCLA professor of <a class="link" href="./Information_studies">information studies</a> <a class="link" href="./Philip_E._Agre">Philip E. Agre</a> and journalist <a class="link" href="./Eric_Boehlert">Eric Boehlert</a> argued that three articles in <a class="link" href="./Wired_News"><i>Wired News</i></a> led to the creation of the widely spread <a class="link" href="./Urban_legend">urban legend</a> that Gore claimed to have "invented the Internet", which followed this interview.</span> <span class="sentence">In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense.</span> <span class="sentence">Internet pioneers <a class="link" href="./Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a> and <a class="link" href="./Bob_Kahn">Bob Kahn</a> stated that "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet."</span> <span class="sentence">Cerf would later state: "Al Gore had seen what happened with the <a class="link" href="./Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956">National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956</a>, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit."</span> <span class="sentence">In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican <a class="link" href="./Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives">Speaker of the United States House of Representatives</a> <a class="link" href="./Newt_Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> also stated: "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen."</span> <span class="sentence">Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day."</span> <span class="sentence">Gore himself would later poke fun at the controversy.</span> <span class="sentence">In 2000, while on the <a class="link" href="./Late_Show_with_David_Letterman"><i>Late Show with David Letterman</i></a> he read <a class="link" href="./Top_10_list_(David_Letterman)"><i>Letterman's Top 10 List</i></a> (which for this show was called, "Top Ten Rejected Gore – <a class="link" href="./Joe_Lieberman">Lieberman</a> Campaign Slogans") to the audience.</span> <span class="sentence">Number nine on the list was: "Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!"</span> <span class="sentence">In 2005 when Gore was awarded the <i>Lifetime Achievement Award</i> "for three decades of contributions to the Internet" at the <a class="link" href="./List_of_Webby_Award_winners#2005"><i><i>Webby Awards</i></i></a> he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): "Please don't recount this vote."</span> <span class="sentence">He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: "We all invented the Internet."</span> <span class="sentence">Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: "It is time to reinvent the Internet for all of us to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy."</span> <span class="sentence">During a speech that he gave on June 16, 1999, in <a class="link" href="./Carthage,_Tennessee">Carthage, Tennessee</a>, Gore formally announced his candidacy for president.</span> <span class="sentence">His major theme was the need to strengthen the American family.</span> <span class="sentence">He was introduced by his eldest daughter, <a class="link" href="./Karenna_Gore_Schiff">Karenna Gore Schiff</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In making the speech, Gore also distanced himself from Bill Clinton, who he stated had lied to him.</span> <span class="sentence">Gore was "briefly interrupted" by <a class="link" href="./HIV/AIDS">AIDS</a> protesters claiming Gore was working with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent access to generic medicines for poor nations and chanting "Gore's greed kills."</span> <span class="sentence">Additional speeches were also interrupted by the protesters.</span> <span class="sentence">Gore responded, "I love this country. I love the <a class="link" href="./First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a> [...] Let me say in response to those who may have chosen an inappropriate way to make their point, that actually the crisis of AIDS in Africa is one that should command the attention of people in the United States and around the world."</span> <span class="sentence">Gore also issued a statement saying that he supported efforts to lower the cost of the AIDS drugs, provided that they "are done in a way consistent with international agreements."</span> <span class="sentence">While Bill Clinton's job-approval ratings were around 60%, an April 1999 study by the <a class="link" href="./Pew_Research_Center">Pew Research Center</a> for the People found that respondents suffered from "Clinton fatigue" where they were "tired of all the problems associated with the Clinton administration" including the Lewinsky scandal and impeachment.</span> <span class="sentence">Texas Governor and likely Republican presidential nominee <a class="link" href="./George_W._Bush">George W.
