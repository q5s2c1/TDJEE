Arthur declined the appointment.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1870, President Grant gave Conkling control over New York <a class="link" href="./Spoils_system">patronage</a>, including the Custom House at the <a class="link" href="./Port_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey#History">Port of New York</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Having become friendly with Murphy over their shared love of horses during summer vacations on the <a class="link" href="./Jersey_Shore">Jersey Shore</a>, in July of that year, Grant appointed him to the Collector's position.</span> <span class="sentence">Murphy's reputation as a <a class="link" href="./War_profiteer">war profiteer</a> and his association with Tammany Hall made him unacceptable to many of his own party, but Conkling convinced the Senate to confirm him.</span> <span class="sentence">The Collector was responsible for hiring hundreds of workers to collect the tariffs due at the United States' busiest port.</span> <span class="sentence">Typically, these jobs were dispensed to adherents of the political machine responsible for appointing the Collector.</span> <span class="sentence">Employees were required to make political contributions (known as "assessments") back to the machine, which made the job a highly coveted political plum.</span> <span class="sentence">Murphy's unpopularity only increased as he replaced workers loyal to Senator <a class="link" href="./Reuben_Fenton">Reuben Fenton's</a> faction of the Republican party with those loyal to Conkling's.</span> <span class="sentence">Eventually, the pressure to replace Murphy grew too great, and Grant asked for his resignation in December 1871.</span> <span class="sentence">Grant offered the position to <a class="link" href="./John_Augustus_Griswold">John Augustus Griswold</a> and <a class="link" href="./William_Orton_(businessman)">William Orton</a>, each of whom declined and recommended Arthur.</span> <span class="sentence">Grant then nominated Arthur, with the <i>New York Times</i> commenting, "his name very seldom rises to the surface of metropolitan life and yet moving like a mighty undercurrent this man during the last 10 years has done more to mold the course of the Republican Party in this state than any other one man in the country."</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate confirmed Arthur's appointment; as Collector he controlled nearly a thousand jobs and received compensation as great as any federal officeholder.</span> <span class="sentence">Arthur's salary was initially $6,500, but senior customs employees were compensated additionally by the "moiety" system, which awarded them a percentage of the cargoes seized and fines levied on importers who attempted to evade the tariff.</span> <span class="sentence">In total, his income came to more than $50,000—more than the president's salary, and more than enough for him to enjoy fashionable clothes and a lavish lifestyle.</span> <span class="sentence">Among those who dealt with the Custom House, Arthur was one of the era's more popular collectors.</span> <span class="sentence">He got along with his subordinates and, since Murphy had already filled the staff with Conkling's adherents, he had few occasions to fire anyone.</span> <span class="sentence">He was also popular within the Republican party as he efficiently collected campaign assessments from the staff and placed party leaders' friends in jobs as positions became available.</span> <span class="sentence">Arthur had a better reputation than Murphy, but reformers still criticized the patronage structure and the moiety system as corrupt.</span> <span class="sentence">A rising tide of reform within the party caused Arthur to rename the financial extractions from employees as "voluntary contributions" in 1872, but the concept remained, and the party reaped the benefit of controlling government jobs.</span> <span class="sentence">In that year, reform-minded Republicans formed the <a class="link" href="./Liberal_Republican_Party_(United_States)">Liberal Republican</a> party and voted against Grant, but he was <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1872">re-elected</a> in spite of their opposition.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, the movement for civil service reform continued to chip away at Conkling's patronage machine; in 1874 Custom House employees were found to have improperly assessed fines against an importing company as a way to increase their own incomes, and Congress reacted, repealing the moiety system and putting the staff, including Arthur, on regular salaries.</span> <span class="sentence">As a result, his income dropped to $12,000 a year—more than his nominal boss, the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>, but far less than what he had previously received.</span>
