    <span class="sentence">Gerry was also unhappy about the lack of expression of any sort of individual liberties in the proposed constitution, and generally opposed proposals that strengthened the central government.</span> <span class="sentence">He was one of only three delegates who voted against the proposed constitution in the convention (the others were <a class="link" href="./George_Mason">George Mason</a> and <a class="link" href="./Edmund_Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a>), citing a concern about the convention's lack of authority to enact such major changes to the nation's system of government, and to the constitution's lack of "<a class="link" href="./Federation">federal features</a>".</span>

    <span class="sentence">Anti-Federalist forces nominated Gerry for governor in 1788, but he was predictably defeated by the popular incumbent John Hancock.</span> <span class="sentence">Following ratification, Gerry recanted his opposition to the Constitution, noting that a number of state ratifying conventions had called for amendments that he supported.</span> <span class="sentence">He was nominated by friends (over his own opposition to the idea) for a seat in the inaugural House of Representatives, where he then served two terms.</span> <span class="sentence">In June 1789 Gerry proposed that Congress consider all of the proposed constitutional amendments that various state ratifying conventions had called for (notably those of <a class="link" href="./Rhode_Island">Rhode Island</a> and <a class="link" href="./North_Carolina">North Carolina</a>, which had at the time still not ratified the constitution).</span> <span class="sentence">In the debate that followed, he led opposition to some of the proposals, arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties.</span> <span class="sentence">He successfully lobbied for inclusion of <a class="link" href="./Freedom_of_assembly">freedom of assembly</a> in the <a class="link" href="./First_Amendment_of_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a>, and was a leading architect of the <a class="link" href="./Fourth_Amendment_of_the_United_States_Constitution">Fourth Amendment</a> protections against search and seizure.</span> <span class="sentence">He sought unsuccessfully to insert the word "expressly" into the <a class="link" href="./Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Tenth Amendment</a>, which might have more significantly limited the federal government's power.</span> <span class="sentence">He was successful in efforts to severely limit the federal government's ability to control state militias.</span> <span class="sentence">In tandem, with this protection, he had once argued against the idea of the federal government controlling a large <a class="link" href="./Standing_army">standing army</a>, comparing it â€“ most memorably and mischievously â€“ to a standing <a class="link" href="./Human_penis">penis</a>: "An excellent assurance of domestic tranquility, but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure."</span> <span class="sentence">Gerry vigorously supported <a class="link" href="./Alexander_Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton's</a> reports on public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamilton's new <a class="link" href="./First_Bank_of_the_United_States">Bank of the United States</a>, positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization.</span> <span class="sentence">Although he speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit (the <a class="link" href="./IOU_(debt)">IOUs</a> at issue), there is no evidence he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank.</span> <span class="sentence">He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to <a class="link" href="./Republicanism_in_the_United_States">republican ideals</a>, and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties.</span> <span class="sentence">He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Treasury_Department">Treasury Department</a> because its head might gain more power than the President.</span> <span class="sentence">He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency (such as the ability to fire cabinet officers), seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments.</span> <span class="sentence">Gerry did not stand for re-election in 1792, returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife.</span> <span class="sentence">He agreed to serve as a presidential elector for John Adams in the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1796">1796 election</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">During Adams' term in office, Gerry maintained good relations with both Adams and Vice President <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, hoping that the divided executive might lead to less friction.</span> <span class="sentence">His hopes were not realized: the split between Federalists (Adams) and Democratic-Republicans (Jefferson) widened.</span>

    <span class="sentence">For four years Gerry unsuccessfully sought the governorship of Massachusetts.</span> <span class="sentence">His opponent in these races, Caleb Strong, was a popular moderate Federalist, whose party dominated the state's politics despite a national shift toward the Republicans.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1803 Republicans in the state were divided, and Gerry only had regional support of the party.</span> <span class="sentence">He decided not to run in 1804, returning to semi-retirement and to deal with a personal financial crisis.</span> <span class="sentence">His brother Samuel Russell had mismanaged his own business affairs, and Gerry had propped him up by guaranteeing a loan that was due.</span> <span class="sentence">The matter ultimately ruined Gerry's finances for his remaining years.</span> <span class="sentence">Republican <a class="link" href="./James_Sullivan_(governor)">James Sullivan</a> won the governor's seat from Strong in 1807, but his successor was unable to hold the seat in the 1809 election, which went to Federalist <a class="link" href="./Christopher_Gore">Christopher Gore</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Gerry stood for election again in 1810 against Gore, and won a narrow victory.</span> <span class="sentence">Republicans cast Gore as an ostentatious British-loving <a class="link" href="./Tory_(British_political_party)">Tory</a> who wanted to restore the monarchy (his parents had remained <a class="link" href="./Loyalist_(American_Revolution)">Loyal</a> during the Revolution), and Gerry as a patriotic American, while Federalists described Gerry as a "French partizan" and Gore as an honest man devoted to ridding the government of foreign influence.</span> <span class="sentence">A temporary lessening in the threat of war with Britain aided Gerry.</span> <span class="sentence">The two battled again in 1811, with Gerry once again victorious in a highly acrimonious campaign.</span> <span class="sentence">Gerry's first year as governor was less controversial than his second, because the Federalists controlled the state senate.</span> <span class="sentence">He preached moderation in the political discourse, noting that it was important that the nation present a unified front in its dealings with foreign powers.</span> <span class="sentence">In his second term, with full Republican control of the legislature, he became notably more partisan, purging much of the state government of Federalist appointees.</span> <span class="sentence">The legislature also enacted "reforms" of the court system that resulted in an increase in the number of judicial appointments, which Gerry filled with Republican partisans.</span> <span class="sentence">Infighting within the party and a shortage of qualified candidates, however, played against Gerry, and the Federalists scored points by complaining vocally about the partisan nature of the reforms.</span> <span class="sentence">Other legislation passed during Gerry's second year included a bill broadening the membership of Harvard's Board of Overseers to diversify its religious membership, and another that liberalized religious taxes.</span> <span class="sentence">The Harvard bill had significant political slant because the recent split between orthodox <a class="link" href="./Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a>s and <a class="link" href="./Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> also divided the state to some extent along party lines, and Federalist Unitarians had recently gained control over the Harvard board.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1812 the state adopted new constitutionally mandated electoral district boundaries.</span> <span class="sentence">The Republican-controlled legislature had created district boundaries designed to enhance their party's control over state and national offices, leading to some oddly shaped legislative districts.</span> <span class="sentence">Although Gerry was unhappy about the highly partisan districting (according to his son-in-law, he thought it "highly disagreeable"), he signed the legislation.</span> <span class="sentence">The shape of one of the state senate districts in <a class="link" href="./Essex_County,_Massachusetts">Essex County</a> was compared to a <a class="link" href="./Salamanders_in_folklore_and_legend">salamander</a> by a local Federalist newspaper in a political cartoon, calling it a "Gerry-mander".</span> <span class="sentence">Ever since, the creation of such districts has been called <a class="link" href="./Gerrymander">gerrymander</a>ing.</span> <span class="sentence">Gerry also engaged in partisan investigations of potential libel against him by elements of the Federalist press, further damaging his popularity with moderates.</span> <span class="sentence">The redistricting controversy, along with the libel investigation and the impending <a class="link" href="./War_of_1812">War of 1812</a>, contributed to Gerry's defeat in 1812 (once again at the hands of Caleb Strong, whom the Federalists had brought out of retirement).</span> <span class="sentence">The gerrymandering of the state senate was a notable success in the 1812 election: the body was thoroughly dominated by Republicans, even though the house and the governor's seat went to Federalists by substantial margins.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Gerry's financial difficulties prompted him to ask President <a class="link" href="./James_Madison">James Madison</a> for a federal position after his loss in the 1812 election (which was held early in the year).</span> <span class="sentence">He was chosen by the Democratic-Republican party congress to be Madison's vice presidential running mate in the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1812">1812 presidential election</a>, although the nomination was first offered to <a class="link" href="./John_Langdon_(politician)">John Langdon</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">He was viewed as a relatively safe choice who would attract Northern votes but not pose a threat to James Monroe, who was thought likely to succeed Madison.</span> <span class="sentence">Madison easily won reelection, and Gerry took the oath of office at Elmwood in March 1813.</span> <span class="sentence">At that time the office of vice president was largely a sinecure; Gerry's duties included advancing the administration's agenda in Congress and dispensing patronage positions in New England.</span> <span class="sentence">Gerry's actions in support of the <a class="link" href="./War_of_1812">War of 1812</a> had a partisan edge: he expressed concerns over a possible Federalist seizure of Fort Adams (as Boston's <a class="link" href="./Fort_Independence_(Massachusetts)">Fort Independence</a> was then known) as a prelude to Anglo-Federalist cooperation, and sought the arrest of printers of Federalist newspapers.</span> <span class="sentence">On November 23, 1814, he fell seriously ill while visiting <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Nourse">Joseph Nourse</a> of the Treasury Department, and died not long after returning to his home in the <a class="link" href="./Seven_Buildings">Seven Buildings</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">He is buried in the <a class="link" href="./Congressional_Cemetery">Congressional Cemetery</a> in Washington, D.C., with a memorial by <a class="link" href="./John_Frazee_(sculptor)">John Frazee</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">He is the only signer of the Declaration buried in the nation's capital.</span> <span class="sentence">The estate he left his wife and children was rich in land and poor in cash; he had managed to repay his brother's debts with his pay as vice president.</span> <span class="sentence">Aged 68 at the start of his Vice Presidency, he would be the oldest person to become Vice President until <a class="link" href="./Charles_Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> in 1929.</span>
