Dobbin</a> delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate.</span> <span class="sentence">On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president.</span> <span class="sentence">Delegates selected Alabama Senator <a class="link" href="./William_R._King">William R. King</a>, a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's <a class="link" href="./Running_mate">running mate</a>, and adopted a <a class="link" href="./Party_platform">party platform</a> that rejected further "agitation" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.</span> <span class="sentence">When word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce found it difficult to believe, and his wife fainted.</span> <span class="sentence">Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would not like to live in Washington.</span> <span class="sentence">The Whig candidate was General Scott, Pierce’s commander in Mexico; his running mate was <a class="link" href="./United_States_Secretary_of_the_Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a class="link" href="./William_Alexander_Graham">William A. Graham</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850.</span> <span class="sentence">This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs.</span> <span class="sentence">The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen <a class="link" href="./Voter_turnout">voter turnout</a> to its lowest level since <a class="link" href="./U.S._presidential_election,_1836">1836</a>; according to biographer Peter A. Wallner, it was "one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history".</span> <span class="sentence">Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for him and the platform; <a class="link" href="./New-York_Tribune"><i>New-York Tribune</i></a> editor <a class="link" href="./Horace_Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, "we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it".</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign.</span> <span class="sentence">It was the custom at the time for candidates to not appear to seek the office, and he did no personal campaigning.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce's opponents caricatured him as an anti-Catholic coward and alcoholic ("the hero of many a well-fought bottle").</span> <span class="sentence">Scott, meanwhile, drew weak support from the Whigs, who were torn by their pro-Compromise platform and found him to be an abysmal, gaffe-prone public speaker.</span> <span class="sentence">The Democrats were confident: a popular slogan was that the Democrats "will <i>pierce</i> their enemies in 1852 as they <i>poked</i> [that is, <a class="link" href="./James_K._Polk">Polked</a>] them in 1844."</span> <span class="sentence">This proved to be true, as Scott won only Kentucky, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Vermont, finishing with 42 electoral votes to Pierce's 254.</span> <span class="sentence">With 3.2 million votes cast, Pierce won the popular vote with 50.9 to 44.1 percent.</span> <span class="sentence">A sizable block of Free Soilers broke for Pierce's in-state rival, Hale, who won 4.9 percent of the popular vote.</span> <span class="sentence">The Democrats took large majorities in Congress.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats.</span> <span class="sentence">In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election.</span> <span class="sentence">The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination.</span> <span class="sentence">Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.</span> <span class="sentence">When balloting began on June 5 at the convention in <a class="link" href="./Cincinnati,_Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, Pierce expected a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority.</span> <span class="sentence">On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest.</span> <span class="sentence">By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan.</span> <span class="sentence">Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case.</span> <span class="sentence">After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner.</span> <span class="sentence">To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of "unqualified approbation" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative <a class="link" href="./John_C._Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>, as the vice-presidential nominee.</span> <span class="sentence">This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce endorsed Buchanan, though the two remained distant; he hoped to resolve the Kansas situation by November to improve the Democrats' chances in the general election.</span> <span class="sentence">He installed <a class="link" href="./John_W._Geary">John W. Geary</a> as territorial governor, who drew the ire of pro-slavery legislators.</span> <span class="sentence">Geary was able to restore order in Kansas, though the electoral damage had already been done—Republicans used "Bleeding Kansas" and "Bleeding Sumner" (the brutal <a class="link" href="./Caning_of_Charles_Sumner">caning of Charles Sumner</a> by South Carolina Representative <a class="link" href="./Preston_Brooks">Preston Brooks</a> in the Senate chamber) as election slogans.</span> <span class="sentence">The Buchanan/Breckinridge ticket was elected, but the Democratic percentage of the popular vote in the North fell from 49.8 percent in 1852 to 41.4 in 1856 as Buchanan won only five of sixteen free states (Pierce had won fourteen), and in three of those, Buchanan won because of a split between the Republican candidate, former California senator <a class="link" href="./John_C._Frémont">John C. Frémont</a> and the Know Nothing, former president Fillmore.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce did not temper his rhetoric after losing the nomination.</span> <span class="sentence">In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists.</span> <span class="sentence">He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations.</span> <span class="sentence">In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted.</span> <span class="sentence">It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce and his cabinet left office on March 4, 1857, the only time in U.S. history that the original cabinet members all remained for a full four-year term.</span>

    <span class="sentence">After efforts to prevent the <a class="link" href="./American_Civil_War">Civil War</a> ended with the firing on <a class="link" href="./Fort_Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, Northern Democrats, including Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. "I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war," Pierce wrote to his wife.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, arguing that even in a time of war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties.</span> <span class="sentence">This stand won him admirers with the emerging <a class="link" href="./Copperheads_(politics)">Northern Peace Democrats</a>, but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.</span> <span class="sentence">In September 1861, Pierce traveled to Michigan, visiting his former Interior Secretary, McClelland, former senator Cass, and others.</span> <span class="sentence">A Detroit bookseller, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, <a class="link" href="./William_H._Seward">William H.

    <span class="sentence">After Pierce died, he mostly passed from the American consciousness, except as one of a series of presidents whose disastrous tenures led to civil war.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the <a class="link" href="./Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States">worst presidents in American history</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in <a class="link" href="./C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> surveys (2000 and 2009).</span> <span class="sentence">Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act.</span> <span class="sentence">Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation.</span> <span class="sentence">The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Eric_Foner">Eric Foner</a> says, "His administration turned out to be one of the most disastrous in American history. It witnessed the collapse of the party system inherited from the Age of Jackson"</span> <span class="sentence">Biographer <a class="link" href="./Roy_Nichols">Roy Nichols</a> argues:</span> <span class="sentence">As a national political leader Pierce was an accident.</span> <span class="sentence">He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability.</span> <span class="sentence">Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies.</span> <span class="sentence">In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side.</span> <span class="sentence">He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England.</span> <span class="sentence">At no time did he catch the popular imagination.</span> <span class="sentence">His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence.</span> <span class="sentence">He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite a reputation as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war.</span> <span class="sentence">To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and as a threat to the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners.</span> <span class="sentence">Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.</span> <span class="sentence">David Potter concludes that the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas–Nebraska Act were "the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration ... Both brought down an avalanche of public criticism."</span> <span class="sentence">More important, says Potter, they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and "popular sovereignty" as political doctrines.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian Kenneth Nivison, writing in 2010, takes a more favorable view of Pierce's foreign policy, stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents <a class="link" href="./William_McKinley">William McKinley</a> and <a class="link" href="./Theodore_Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who served at a time when America had the military might to make her desires stick.</span> <span class="sentence">"American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s, which eventually supplanted European colonialism by the middle of the twentieth century, owed much to the paternalism of Jacksonian Democracy cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce."</span> <span class="sentence">Historian Larry Gara, who authored a book on Pierce's presidency, wrote in the former president's entry in <i>American National Biography Online</i>:</span> <span class="sentence">He was president at a time that called for almost superhuman skills, yet he lacked such skills and never grew into the job to which he had been elected.</span> <span class="sentence">His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past.</span> <span class="sentence">He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North.</span> <span class="sentence">He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [the <a class="link" href="./Guano_Islands_Act">Guano Islands Act</a>].</span> <span class="sentence">His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife.</span> <span class="sentence">His support for the Kansas–Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.</span>
