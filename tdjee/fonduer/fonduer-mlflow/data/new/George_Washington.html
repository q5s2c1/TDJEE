href="./Virginia_Regiment">Virginia Regiment</a>, at the age of twenty-one, and sent him to confront French forces at Pittsburgh.</span> <span class="sentence">Dindwiddie ordered Washington to take prisoners, destroy, or kill those who resisted British control of the region.</span> <span class="sentence">He set out on April 2 with 150 men, and received news en route that a French force had driven out colonial traders and begun construction of <a class="link" href="./Fort_Duquesne">Fort Duquesne</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Tanacharison and a few warriors discovered a small detachment of French troops east of <a class="link" href="./Uniontown,_Pennsylvania">Uniontown, Pennsylvania</a> led by <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Coulon_de_Jumonville">Joseph Coulon de Jumonville</a>, so Washington built an entrenched camp at Great Meadows which he called <a class="link" href="./Fort_Necessity_National_Battlefield">Fort Necessity</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">He then led his unit and their <a class="link" href="./Mingo">Mingo</a> allies in an ambush against the French on May 28 in the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Jumonville_Glen">Battle of Jumonville Glen</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">There are discrepancies, but primary accounts indicate that the battle lasted about 15 minutes.</span> <span class="sentence">Jumonville was killed and most of his party were taken prisoner or killed, and Tanacharison nicknamed Washington the "Town Destroyer".</span> <span class="sentence">In July 1754, the French responded by attacking Fort Necessity in a <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Fort_Necessity">ten-hour battle</a> which ended in Washington's only surrender and the return of his force to Virginia—but only after he signed a falsely translated surrender document saying that he had "assassinated" Jumonville, and this mistranslated false confession became the pretext to blame him for starting a war.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Ellis">Joseph Ellis</a> concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery and initiative, as well as his inexperience and impetuosity.</span> <span class="sentence">Upon his return to Virginia, Washington refused to accept a demotion to the rank of captain, and resigned his commission.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington's expedition into the Ohio Country had international consequences.</span> <span class="sentence">The French accused him of assassinating Jumonville, claiming that Jumonville was only on a diplomatic mission.</span> <span class="sentence">Both France and Great Britain were set to fight for control of the region, both sending in troops in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1755, the British Crown sent General <a class="link" href="./Edward_Braddock">Edward Braddock</a> and regulars to take Fort Duquesne.</span> <span class="sentence">This was the largest British expedition to the colonies, intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country.</span> <span class="sentence">Braddock offered Washington the position of aide on his staff, who accepted.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington recommended that Braddock split the army into two divisions—a primary column and a second, more lightly equipped mobile offensive "flying column".</span> <span class="sentence">During the march, Washington became severely ill, and was left behind, but he was able to rejoin Braddock at <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_the_Monongahela">Monongahela</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The next day the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock's divided forces, and the British general was mortally wounded.</span> <span class="sentence">The British suffered devastating casualties and retreated in panic, with two-thirds killed or wounded, but Washington rallied his forces in an organized retreat—though he was suffering from a fever and headache.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington's had two horses shot from beneath him, and his hat and coat were bullet-pierced.</span> <span class="sentence">His conduct under fire redeemed his reputation among critics of his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was not included by the succeeding commander Colonel Thomas Dunbar in planning subsequent operations.</span> <span class="sentence">On August 14, 1755, Dinwiddie appointed Washington colonel and commander in chief of all of Virginia's colonial military forces, to protect Virginia's frontier from Indian attacks.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was twenty-three, in charge of defending 300 miles, while having only 300 men.</span> <span class="sentence">Savage costly frontier battles took place, 20 battles in ten months, between Washington's <a class="link" href="./Virginia_Regiment">Virginia Regiment</a> and the Indians.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington desired to wear the coveted red coat of officer rank, but this eluded him.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was convinced that Braddock would have recommended him for a regular commission in the British army, so he appealed to Braddock's successor <a class="link" href="./John_Campbell,_4th_Earl_of_Loudoun">Lord Loudoun</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The martinet British general refused Washington's request but did agree to transfer responsibility for Fort Cumberland from Virginia to Maryland.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington resented the unsuccessful encounter with Louden.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington's command increased to a thousand soldiers, while he emphasized discipline and training.</span> <span class="sentence">Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies as a result of his strenuous efforts, and Ellis concludes that "it was his only unqualified success" during the French and Indian War.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington sympathized with the plight of Virginia.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington continued to advocate the capture of French Fort Duquesne.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1758, the British crown sent Commanding General <a class="link" href="./John_Forbes_(British_Army_officer)">John Forbes</a>, Colonel <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Gage">Thomas Gage</a>, and British regulars to take the post.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was promoted honorary Brigadier General, while he and two regiments under his command, were ordered to cooperate.</span> <span class="sentence">During the <a class="link" href="./Forbes_Expedition">expedition</a>, Washington suggested an Indian-style warfare method be incorporated but this was ignored.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was involved in only one battle during the campaign.Forbes had devised a plan for an assault on Fort Duquesne and assigned Washington to lead one of three brigades.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was the only colonial officer among the British forces.</span> <span class="sentence">Forbes was alerted to an enemy reconnaissance party in the area and sent Colonel <a class="link" href="./George_Mercer_(military_officer)">George Mercer</a> and a contingent of several hundred Virginians to investigate.</span> <span class="sentence">When "hot firing" was heard in the distance Washington's unit responded, but they found themselves in a friendly-fire incident when reinforcements also arrived, each contingent thinking that the other was the French enemy and resulting in minor casualties.</span> <span class="sentence">In late November, for the final assault on the fort, Forbes assembled 2,500 men and promoted Washington to honorary brevet brigadier general to head the operation.</span> <span class="sentence">Shortly thereafter, on the 25th, Washington and his army arrived, only to find an abandoned charred fort for the capture.</span> <span class="sentence">The British did score a strategic victory by gaining control of the <a class="link" href="./Ohio_Valley">Ohio Valley</a>, but Washington retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758, and returned to Mount Vernon, while the French and Indian War was concluded in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris.</span> <span class="sentence">Although Washington never gained a Royal commission that he sought, he acquired military, political, and leadership skills which would prove invaluable during the American Revolution.</span> <span class="sentence">Historians ascribe his support of a strong national government and a vigorous executive to his frustrations with officials in these and later interactions.</span> <span class="sentence">He developed a distinct preference for regular troops over undisciplined militia, even though his command was limited during this war to smaller and more rural forces than during the Revolution.</span>

the late 18th century that advocated "moral teachings".</span> <span class="sentence">He was attracted by the movement's dedication to the Enlightenment principles of rationality, reason, and
