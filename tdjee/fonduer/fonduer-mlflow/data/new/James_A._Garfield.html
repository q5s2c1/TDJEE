Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!"</span> <span class="sentence">The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell "...quite as significant for what it did not contain as for what it did."</span> <span class="sentence">In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after the Illinoisan's death Garfield stated that, "Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln," and in 1878 called Lincoln "...one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power."</span>

    <span class="sentence">Entering the presidency, Garfield had little foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine.</span> <span class="sentence">Blaine, a former <a class="link" href="./Protectionism">protectionist</a>, now agreed with Garfield on the need to promote freer trade, especially within the <a class="link" href="./Western_Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Their reasons were twofold: firstly, Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with <a class="link" href="./Latin_America">Latin America</a> would be the best way to keep Great Britain from dominating the region.</span> <span class="sentence">Secondly, by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity.</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade.</span> <span class="sentence">At the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the <a class="link" href="./War_of_the_Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> then being fought by <a class="link" href="./Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a class="link" href="./Chile">Chile</a>, and <a class="link" href="./Peru">Peru</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital, <a class="link" href="./Lima">Lima</a>, rejected any settlement that restored the previous <i>status quo</i>.</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the <a class="link" href="./Clayton-Bulwer_Treaty">Clayton-Bulwer Treaty</a> to allow the United States to construct <a class="link" href="./Panama_Canal">a canal through Panama</a> without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located <a class="link" href="./Kingdom_of_Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with <a class="link" href="./Joseon_Dynasty">Korea</a> and <a class="link" href="./Merina_Kingdom">Madagascar</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield also considered enhancing the United States' military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization.</span> <span class="sentence">In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated.</span> <span class="sentence">Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference.</span> <span class="sentence">Naval reform continued under Arthur, if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending in the construction of the <a class="link" href="./Squadron_of_Evolution">Squadron of Evolution</a>.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Garfield was shot by <a class="link" href="./Charles_J._Guiteau">Charles J. Guiteau</a>, a disgruntled office seeker, at the <a class="link" href="./Baltimore_and_Potomac_Railroad_Station">Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station</a> in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881.</span> <span class="sentence">After eleven weeks of intensive and other care Garfield died in <a class="link" href="./Elberon,_New_Jersey">Elberon, New Jersey</a>, the second of four presidents to be assassinated, following Abraham Lincoln.</span> <span class="sentence">Guiteau had followed various professions in his life, but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected would be the winning Republican ticket.</span> <span class="sentence">He composed a speech, "Garfield vs. Hancock", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee.</span> <span class="sentence">One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak.</span> <span class="sentence">On one occasion, according to Kenneth D. Ackerman in his book about Garfield's candidacy and assassination, Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves.</span> <span class="sentence">Guiteau, who considered himself a <a class="link" href="./Stalwart_(politics)">Stalwart</a>, deemed his contribution to Garfield's victory sufficient to justify the position of consul in Paris, despite the fact he spoke no French, nor any foreign language.</span> <span class="sentence">Guiteau has since been described by one medical expert as possibly being a narcissistic schizophrenic; author Kent Kiehl assessed him as being a clinical psychopath.</span> <span class="sentence">One of President Garfield's more wearying duties was seeing office seekers, and he saw Guiteau at least once.</span> <span class="sentence">White House officials suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State.</span> <span class="sentence">Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions.</span> <span class="sentence">Blaine, who had no intention of giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation.</span> <span class="sentence">Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.</span> <span class="sentence">Guiteau came to believe he had lost the position because he was a Stalwart.</span> <span class="sentence">The office-seeker decided that the only way to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president.</span> <span class="sentence">Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.</span> <span class="sentence">The <a class="link" href="./Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a> was deemed a fluke due to the Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why the president should be guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers.</span> <span class="sentence">Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then.</span> <span class="sentence">He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve.</span> <span class="sentence">His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.</span> <span class="sentence">Guiteau concealed himself by the ladies' waiting room at the Sixth Street Station of the <a class="link" href="./Baltimore_and_Potomac_Railroad">Baltimore and Potomac Railroad</a>, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart.</span> <span class="sentence">Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him at least part of the way.</span> <span class="sentence">Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off.</span> <span class="sentence">The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm.</span> <span class="sentence">The time was 9:30 a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured.</span> <span class="sentence">As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.</span>

he was not successful.</span> <span class="sentence">One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington's summer heat was one of the first successful <a class="link" href="./Air_conditioning">air conditioning</a> units: air that was propelled by fans over ice and then dried had reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).</span> <span class="sentence">Beginning on July 23, Garfield took a turn for the worse.</span> <span class="sentence">His temperature increased to 104 F; doctors, concerned by an <a class="link" href="./Abscess">abscess</a> that had developed by the wound, operated and inserted a drainage tube.</span> <span class="sentence">This initially seemed to help, and Garfield, in his bed, was able to hold a brief cabinet meeting on July 29, though members were under orders from Bliss to discuss nothing that might excite Garfield.</span> <span class="sentence">Doctors probed the abscess, which went into Garfield's body, hoping to find the bullet; they most likely only made the infections worse.</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield performed only one state act in August, signing an extradition paper.</span> <span class="sentence">By the end of the month, the president was much more feeble than he had been, and his weight had decreased to 130 lb.Garfield had long been anxious to escape hot, unhealthy Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to <a class="link" href="./Elberon,_New_Jersey">Elberon</a>, part of <a class="link" href="./Long_Branch,_New_Jersey">Long Branch, New Jersey</a>, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer.</span> <span class="sentence">He left the White House for the last time on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers.</span> <span class="sentence">There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch.</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield's personal secretary, <a class="link" href="./Joe_Stanley_Brown">Joe Stanley Brown</a>, wrote 40 years later, "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy."</span> <span class="sentence">On September 18, Garfield asked A. F. Rockwell, a friend, if he would have a place in history.</span> <span class="sentence">Rockwell assured him he would, and told Garfield he had much work still before him.</span> <span class="sentence">But his response was, "No, my work is done."</span> <span class="sentence">The following day, Garfield, by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains, marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well, and went to sleep without discomfort.</span> <span class="sentence">He awoke that evening around 10:15 p.m. with great pain in his chest.</span> <span class="sentence">The attendant watching him sent for Bliss, who found him unconscious.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite efforts to revive him, Garfield never awoke, and died at 10:35 p.m. that evening.</span> <span class="sentence">Learning from a reporter of Garfield's death, <a class="link" href="./Chester_A._Arthur">Arthur</a> took the presidential oath of office administered by New York Supreme Court Justice <a class="link" href="./John_R._Brady">John R.

    <span class="sentence">For a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">Peskin noted that, "In mourning Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations."</span> <span class="sentence">As the rivalry between Stalwarts and <a class="link" href="./Half-Breed_(politics)">Half-Breeds</a> faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield.</span> <span class="sentence">Beginning in 1882, the year after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office began issuing postage stamps honoring the late president.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite his short term as president, nine different issues were printed over the years.</span> <span class="sentence">In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes.</span> <span class="sentence">Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten.</span> <span class="sentence">The 20th century saw no revival for Garfield.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Thomas_Wolfe">Thomas Wolfe</a> deemed the presidents of the <a class="link" href="./Gilded_Age">Gilded Age</a>, including Garfield, "lost Americans" whose "gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed, melted, swam together."</span> <span class="sentence">The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye, their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time: the <a class="link" href="./Robber_baron_(industrialist)">robber barons</a>, the inventors, those who had sought social reform, and others who had lived as America rapidly changed.</span> <span class="sentence">Current events and more recent figures occupied America's attention: according to Ackerman, "the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield's era seem remote and irrelevant, its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity."</span> <span class="sentence">Garfield's biographers, and those who have studied his presidency, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Justus_D._Doenecke">Justus D.
