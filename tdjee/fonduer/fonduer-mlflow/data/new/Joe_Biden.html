    <span class="sentence">Biden had thought about running for president again ever since his failed 1988 bid.</span> <span class="sentence">Biden declared his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, after having discussed running for months prior, and first made a formal announcement to <a class="link" href="./Tim_Russert">Tim Russert</a> on <a class="link" href="./Meet_the_Press"><i>Meet the Press</i></a> on January 7, stating he would "be the best Biden I can be."</span> <span class="sentence">In January 2006, Delaware newspaper columnist Harry F.

Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" Other candidates' comments that "Joe is right" in the <a class="link" href="./Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_debates,_2008">Democratic debates</a> were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training."</span> <span class="sentence">Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas.</span> <span class="sentence">Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner <a class="link" href="./Rudy_Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> at the debate on October 30, 2007, in <a class="link" href="./Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11."</span> <span class="sentence">Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor, and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.</span> <span class="sentence">Biden made remarks during the campaign that attracted controversy.</span> <span class="sentence">On the day of his January 2007 announcement, he spoke of fellow Democratic candidate and Senator <a class="link" href="./Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a>: "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man."</span> <span class="sentence">This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities; it later took second place on <i>Time</i> magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007.</span> <span class="sentence">Biden had earlier been criticized in July 2006 for a remark he made about his support among <a class="link" href="./Indian_American">Indian American</a>s: "I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking."</span> <span class="sentence">Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.</span> <span class="sentence">Overall, Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator <a class="link" href="./Hillary_Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>; he never rose above single digits in the national polls of the Democratic candidates.</span> <span class="sentence">In the initial contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the <a class="link" href="./Iowa_Democratic_caucuses,_2008">Iowa caucuses</a>, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.</span> <span class="sentence">Biden withdrew from the race that evening, saying "There is nothing sad about tonight.... I feel no regret."</span> <span class="sentence">Despite the lack of success, Biden's stature in the political world rose as the result of his campaign.</span> <span class="sentence">In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama.</span> <span class="sentence">Although the two had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close, with Biden having resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom, and Obama having viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.</span> <span class="sentence">Now, having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaigning style and appeal to working class voters, and Biden was convinced that Obama was "the real deal".</span>
