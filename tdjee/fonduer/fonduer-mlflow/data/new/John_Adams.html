    <span class="sentence">On March 5, 1770, a lone British sentry was accosted by American men and boys.</span> <span class="sentence">Eight British <a class="link" href="./29th_(Worcestershire)_Regiment_of_Foot">soldiers</a> reinforced him as the crowd around them grew to several hundred.</span> <span class="sentence">The people threw snowballs, ice, and stones at the troops.</span> <span class="sentence">In the chaos, the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians in what came to be called the <a class="link" href="./Boston_Massacre">Boston Massacre</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges.</span> <span class="sentence">The following day, Adams was asked to defend them after others had refused, and he immediately agreed to do so. He acknowledged that the task might hurt his reputation but believed that no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial.</span> <span class="sentence">The trials were delayed so that passions could cool.</span> <span class="sentence">The trial of the commander, Captain <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Preston_(British_Army_officer)">Thomas Preston</a>, began on October 24 and ended on October 30. Preston was acquitted because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire.</span> <span class="sentence">The trial of the remaining soldiers took place in December.</span> <span class="sentence">In arguing their case, Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions: "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."</span> <span class="sentence">He added, "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever."</span> <span class="sentence">Adams won acquittal for six of the soldiers.</span> <span class="sentence">Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter after being charged for murder.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.</span> <span class="sentence">Biographer <a class="link" href="./John_E._Ferling">John E. Ferling</a> suggests that Adams made the most of <a class="link" href="./Voir_dire">jury selection</a>, saying that he "expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles."</span> <span class="sentence">While benefitting from prosecutorial mismanagement, Adams still "performed brilliantly."</span> <span class="sentence">Ferling also surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.</span> <span class="sentence">The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree, but kept his office in Boston.</span> <span class="sentence">He also noted on the day of the family's move, "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else."</span> <span class="sentence">After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and "vulgar" Braintree as a home for his family.</span> <span class="sentence">In August 1772, Adams moved his family back to Boston.</span> <span class="sentence">He purchased a large brick house on <a class="link" href="./Court_Street_(Boston)">Queen Street</a>, not far from his office.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.</span>

    <span class="sentence">In the spring of 1776, Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary in order to establish trade, and conversely trade was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with France.</span> <span class="sentence">He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, <a class="link" href="./Benjamin_Harrison_V">Benjamin Harrison V</a> of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, "to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers."</span> <span class="sentence">While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the <a class="link" href="./Model_Treaty">Model Treaty</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance.</span> <span class="sentence">There were provisions for what constituted French territory.</span> <span class="sentence">The treaty adhered to the provision that "<a class="link" href="./Freedom_of_navigation">free ships make free goods</a>," allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband.</span> <span class="sentence">By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Brandywine">defeated</a> General Washington and captured Philadelphia.</span> <span class="sentence">More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed in order to defeat Britain and end to the war.</span> <span class="sentence">The defeat of the British at <a class="link" href="./Battles_of_Saratoga">Saratoga</a> was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.</span> <span class="sentence">By late 1777, America's financial and military situations were dire.</span> <span class="sentence">After a British army <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Brandywine">defeated</a> General Washington and captured Philadelphia that September, it became more widely held that French military assistance would be needed to win the war.</span> <span class="sentence">The defeat of the British at <a class="link" href="./Battles_of_Saratoga">Saratoga</a> was expected to help induce France to agree to an <a class="link" href="./Military_alliance">alliance</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">On November 27, 1777 Adams accepted a position as commissioner to France, joining Franklin and <a class="link" href="./Arthur_Lee_(diplomat)">Arthur Lee</a> in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French.</span> <span class="sentence">Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was "of inestimable value" to his maturation.</span> <span class="sentence">On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the <a class="link" href="./Frigate">frigate</a> <a class="link" href="./USS_Boston_(1777)"><i>Boston</i></a>, commanded by Captain <a class="link" href="./Samuel_Tucker">Samuel Tucker</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The stormy trip was treacherous.</span> <span class="sentence">Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one.</span> <span class="sentence">The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one.</span> <span class="sentence">A cannon malfunction killed one and injured five of the crew.</span> <span class="sentence">On April 1, the men arrived in Spain, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an <a class="link" href="./Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)">alliance</a> with the United States on February 6.</span> <span class="sentence">Shortly after, they arrived in France.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French.</span> <span class="sentence">He assumed a less visible role but imposed order and methods needed by his delegation's finances and record-keeping.</span> <span class="sentence">Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister <a class="link" href="./Charles_Gravier,_comte_de_Vergennes">Vergennes</a> in December, arguing for French naval support in North America.</span> <span class="sentence">Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it. In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him <a class="link" href="./Minister_plenipotentiary">minister plenipotentiary</a> to France while Lee was sent to Spain.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams received no instructions.</span> <span class="sentence">Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779.</span> <span class="sentence">On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.</span> <span class="sentence">That fall, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war.</span> <span class="sentence">Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November aboard the French frigate <i>Sensible</i> – accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles.</span> <span class="sentence">Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business.</span> <span class="sentence">He also increased his usefulness by mastering the French language.</span> <span class="sentence">Lee was eventually recalled.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams closely supervised his sons' education but wrote infrequently to Abigail, only about once every ten days.</span> <span class="sentence">In contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically.</span> <span class="sentence">The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution.</span> <span class="sentence">The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands "above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water."</span> <span class="sentence">In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar.</span> <span class="sentence">Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting.</span> <span class="sentence">In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to "retrace its steps."</span> <span class="sentence">Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied, but also airing out other grievances he had with the French.</span> <span class="sentence">The alliance had been made over two years before.</span> <span class="sentence">During that time, an army under the <a class="link" href="./Jean-Baptiste_Donatien_de_Vimeur,_comte_de_Rochambeau">comte de Rochambeau</a> had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships.</span> <span class="sentence">These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy.</span> <span class="sentence">However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies in order to protect French interests there.</span> <span class="sentence">France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance.</span> <span class="sentence">Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams then left France of his own accord.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Adams was appointed the first American ambassador to Great Britain in 1785.</span> <span class="sentence">When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American."</span> <span class="sentence">After arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with King George III on June 1 (which he meticulously recorded in a letter to now-Foreign Minister Jay the next day).</span> <span class="sentence">The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality "between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood," and the King agreed to "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States."</span> <span class="sentence">The King added that although "he had been the last to consent" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right.</span> <span class="sentence">Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France."</span> <span class="sentence">Adams replied, "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country."</span> <span class="sentence">To this King George responded, "An honest Man will never have any other."</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was joined by Abigail while in London.</span> <span class="sentence">Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out <a class="link" href="./Richard_Price">Richard Price</a>, minister of <a class="link" href="./Newington_Green_Unitarian_Church">Newington Green Unitarian Church</a> and instigator of the <a class="link" href="./Revolution_Controversy">debate over the Revolution</a> within Britain.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at Harvard, cautioning the former against the "smell of the midnight lamp" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites.</span> <span class="sentence">While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:</span> <span class="sentence">Adams' tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations.</span> <span class="sentence">The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams' attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home.</span> <span class="sentence">The news he received of tumult at home, such as <a class="link" href="./Shays'_Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a>, heightened his anxiety.</span> <span class="sentence">He then asked Jay to be relieved; in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams then went to The Hague to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans.</span>

    <span class="sentence">The sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the U.S. Senate, where he can cast a tie-breaking vote.</span> <span class="sentence">On at least one occasion, Adams persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed.</span> <span class="sentence">Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government.</span> <span class="sentence">Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as "George Washington, President of the United States," the Senate debated the issue at some length.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams favored the adoption of the style of <i>Highness</i> (as well as the title of <i>Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties</i>) for the president.</span> <span class="sentence">Some senators favored a variant of <i>Highness</i> or the lesser <i>Excellency</i>." <a class="link" href="./Anti-Federalism">Anti-federalists</a> in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as "superlatively ridiculous." The Senate emphasized simplicity and republicanism, and many argued that these "distinctions," as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's prohibition on titles of nobility. Adams argued that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with "dignity and splendor" in order to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. "For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair," wrote Senator <a class="link" href="./William_Maclay_(Pennsylvania_senator)">William Maclay</a> of Pennsylvania.

    <span class="sentence">The election of 1796 was the first contested American presidential election.</span> <span class="sentence">Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his <a class="link" href="./Presidency_of_George_Washington">presidency</a>, deep philosophical differences between the two leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and Republican parties.</span> <span class="sentence">Thus, when Washington announced that he would not be a candidate for a third term, an intense <a class="link" href="./Partisan_(political)">partisan</a> struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.</span> <span class="sentence">Like the previous two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796.</span> <span class="sentence">The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then chose a president.</span> <span class="sentence">In seven states voters chose the presidential electors.</span> <span class="sentence">In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature.</span> <span class="sentence">The clear Republican favorite was Jefferson.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was the Federalist frontrunner.</span> <span class="sentence">The Republicans held a <a class="link" href="./Congressional_nominating_caucus">congressional nominating caucus</a> and named Jefferson and <a class="link" href="./Aaron_Burr">Aaron Burr</a> as their presidential choices.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson at first declined the nomination, but he agreed to run a few weeks later.</span> <span class="sentence">Federalist members of Congress held an informal nominating caucus and named Adams and <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Pinckney">Thomas Pinckney</a> as their candidates.</span> <span class="sentence">The campaign was for the most part confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets and political rallies; of the four contenders, only Burr actively campaigned.</span> <span class="sentence">The practice of not campaigning for office would remain for many decades.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called the "silly and wicked game" of electioneering.</span> <span class="sentence">As the campaign progressed, fears grew among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions.</span> <span class="sentence">Indeed, Adams felt largely left out of Washington's administration and did not consider himself a strong member of the Federalist Party.</span> <span class="sentence">He had remarked that Hamilton's economic program, centered around banks, would "swindle" the poor and unleash the "gangrene of avarice."</span> <span class="sentence">Desiring "a more pliant president than Adams," Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney.</span> <span class="sentence">He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for "<a class="link" href="./Favorite_son">favorite son</a>" Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">Hamilton's scheme was undone when several <a class="link" href="./New_England">New England</a> state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for Pinckney.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams wrote shortly after the election that Hamilton was a "proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know."</span> <span class="sentence">Throughout his life, Adams made a number of highly critical statements about Hamilton.</span> <span class="sentence">He made derogatory references to his womanizing, real or alleged, and slurred him as the "<a class="link" href="./Creole_peoples">Creole</a> bastard."</span> <span class="sentence">In the end, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30. The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among nine other candidates.</span> <span class="sentence">This is the only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Ellis">Joseph Ellis</a> writes that "[t]he Adams presidency was destined to be dominated by a single question of American policy to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding occupant of the office."</span> <span class="sentence">That question was whether to make war with France or find peace.</span> <span class="sentence">In Europe, <a class="link" href="./French_Revolutionary_Wars">Britain and France were at war</a> as a result of the French Revolution.</span> <span class="sentence">Hamilton and the Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France.</span> <span class="sentence">The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss.</span> <span class="sentence">When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war.</span> <span class="sentence">Because of the Jay Treaty, the French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British.</span> <span class="sentence">Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy, and would not tolerate war with France.</span> <span class="sentence">On May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France.</span> <span class="sentence">He announced that he would send a peace commission to France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat.</span> <span class="sentence">The speech was well received by the Federalists.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and the "emblems of defense" in the other.</span> <span class="sentence">The Republicans were outraged, for Adams had not only failed to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it.Sentiments changed with the <a class="link" href="./XYZ_Affair">XYZ Affair</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams, as expressed in his speech, had appointed a three-member commission to negotiate with France.</span> <span class="sentence">The commission consisted of <a class="link" href="./John_Marshall">John Marshall</a>, <a class="link" href="./Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney</a> and <a class="link" href="./Elbridge_Gerry">Elbridge Gerry</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson met four times with Joseph Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia.</span> <span class="sentence">Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but "then drag out the negotiations at length" in order to arrive at most favorable solution.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams "vain, suspicious, and stubborn."</span> <span class="sentence">When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister <a class="link" href="./Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-Périgord">Talleyrand</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The diplomats were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents.</span> <span class="sentence">The French emissaries (later code-named, X, Y, and Z) refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France.</span> <span class="sentence">Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to France by Adams in his speech.</span> <span class="sentence">The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms.</span> <span class="sentence">Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.</span> <span class="sentence">News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in the form of a memorandum from Marshall on March 4, 1798.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details.</span> <span class="sentence">He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses.</span> <span class="sentence">The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures.</span> <span class="sentence">Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers.</span> <span class="sentence">Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were "struck dumb."</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Benjamin_Franklin_Bache">Benjamin Franklin Bache</a>, editor of the <a class="link" href="./Philadelphia_Aurora">Philadelphia Aurora</a>, blamed Adams' aggression as the cause of the disaster.</span> <span class="sentence">Among the general public, the effects were very different.</span> <span class="sentence">The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Despite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted.</span> <span class="sentence">Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest.</span> <span class="sentence">In an attempt to quell the uprising, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the <a class="link" href="./Alien_and_Sedition_Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, which were signed by Adams in 1798.</span> <span class="sentence">Congress specifically passed four measures – the <a class="link" href="./Naturalization_Act_of_1798">Naturalization Act</a>, the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act.</span> <span class="sentence">All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an "unguarded passion."</span> <span class="sentence">The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the President greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements.</span> <span class="sentence">The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" against the government or its officials.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet.</span> <span class="sentence">He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law.</span> <span class="sentence">The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers.</span> <span class="sentence">The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election.</span> <span class="sentence">Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans.</span> <span class="sentence">The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists.</span> <span class="sentence">Congressman <a class="link" href="./Matthew_Lyon">Matthew Lyon</a> of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the President.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens.</span> <span class="sentence">Vast numbers left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment.</span> <span class="sentence">Republicans were outraged.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the <a class="link" href="./Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the "natural right" to <a class="link" href="./Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)">nullify</a> any acts they deemed unconstitutional.</span> <span class="sentence">Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to "sever ourselves from the union we so much value."</span> <span class="sentence">Federalists reacted bitterly to the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts.</span> <span class="sentence">Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.</span>

    <span class="sentence">In May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor.</span> <span class="sentence">An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the <a class="link" href="./Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe.</span> <span class="sentence">He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests.</span> <span class="sentence">In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department.</span> <span class="sentence">The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army.</span> <span class="sentence">Hamilton and other "High Federalists" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of the common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty.</span> <span class="sentence">In May, a "provisional" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress.</span> <span class="sentence">In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies.</span> <span class="sentence">These numbers exceeded Adams' requests but fell short of Hamilton's.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army.</span> <span class="sentence">Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command the army without consulting him.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates.</span> <span class="sentence">He wished to have <a class="link" href="./Henry_Knox">Henry Knox</a> as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney.</span> <span class="sentence">On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to <a class="link" href="./Mount_Vernon">Mount Vernon</a> in order to convince Washington to accept the post.</span> <span class="sentence">McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and <a class="link" href="./Frederick_Muhlenberg">Frederick Muhlenberg</a> in order to make the army appear bipartisan.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">Knox refused to serve under these conditions.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority.</span> <span class="sentence">On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate.</span> <span class="sentence">The severe illness of Abigail during this time, whom Adams was feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration.</span> <span class="sentence">It quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's <i>de facto</i> commander.</span> <span class="sentence">He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams built up the Navy, adding <a class="link" href="./Six_original_United_States_frigates">six fast, powerful frigates</a>, most notably the USS <i>Constitution</i>.</span> <span class="sentence">The Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_the_Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>, which lessened their strength and, it was hoped, would make them more disposed to negotiate.</span> <span class="sentence">In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation.</span> <span class="sentence">That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses.</span> <span class="sentence">The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans.</span> <span class="sentence">In February 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat <a class="link" href="./William_Vans_Murray">William Vans Murray</a> on a peace mission to France.</span> <span class="sentence">The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a "master stroke."</span> <span class="sentence">To placate Republicans, he nominated <a class="link" href="./Patrick_Henry">Patrick Henry</a> and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them.</span> <span class="sentence">Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams' cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them.</span> <span class="sentence">To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months–March to September–of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the <a class="link" href="./Yellow_fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.</span> <span class="sentence">Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at Trenton to speak with the President, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the <a class="link" href="./House_of_Bourbon">Bourbons</a> to France.</span> <span class="sentence">"I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool," Adams said.</span> <span class="sentence">He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched.</span> <span class="sentence">On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.</span>

    <span class="sentence">To pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the <a class="link" href="./Direct_tax">Direct Tax</a> of 1798.</span> <span class="sentence">Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from <a class="link" href="./Excise_tax">excise tax</a>es and <a class="link" href="./Tariffs_in_United_States_history">tariffs</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue.</span> <span class="sentence">The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a <a class="link" href="./Progressive_tax">progressive</a> <a class="link" href="./Land_value_tax">land value tax</a> of up to 1% of the value of a property.</span> <span class="sentence">Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out.</span> <span class="sentence">Led by Revolutionary War veteran <a class="link" href="./John_Fries">John Fries</a>, rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their republican liberties and to their churches.</span> <span class="sentence">They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business.</span> <span class="sentence">The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.</span> <span class="sentence">Fries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang.</span> <span class="sentence">They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon.</span> <span class="sentence">The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion.</span> <span class="sentence">In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that "it was impossible to commit a greater error."</span>

    <span class="sentence">On May 5, Adams' frustrations with the Hamilton wing of the party exploded during a meeting with McHenry, a Hamilton loyalist who was universally regarded as an inept Secretary of War.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted.</span> <span class="sentence">On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign.</span> <span class="sentence">Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and <a class="link" href="./Samuel_Dexter">Samuel Dexter</a> as Secretary of War.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1799, <a class="link" href="./Napoleon">Napoleon</a> took over as head of the French government in the <a class="link" href="./Coup_of_18_Brumaire">Coup of 18 Brumaire</a> and declared the French Revolution over.</span> <span class="sentence">This increased Adams' desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton.</span> <span class="sentence">His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition.</span> <span class="sentence">Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in the summer of 1800.</span> <span class="sentence">Napoleon, realizing that the conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations.</span> <span class="sentence">At the <a class="link" href="./Convention_of_1800">Convention of 1800</a>, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation.</span> <span class="sentence">On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16–14 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds.</span> <span class="sentence">Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations.</span> <span class="sentence">A list of reservations was then drawn up demanding that the <a class="link" href="./Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)">Treaty of Alliance of 1778</a> be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property.</span> <span class="sentence">On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22–9 and was signed by Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Ron_Chernow">Ron Chernow</a> writes that "the threat of Jacobinism" was the one thing that united the Federalist Party, and that Adams' elimination of it unwittingly contributed to the party's demise.</span> <span class="sentence">News of the peace treaty did not arrive in the United States until after the election, too late to sway the results.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions.</span> <span class="sentence">At times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches, suggesting for example that "hereditary monarchy or aristocracy" are the "only institutions that can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people."</span> <span class="sentence">Yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas, calling himself "a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy" and "no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in America."</span> <span class="sentence">Such denials did not assuage his critics, and Adams was often accused of being a monarchist.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Clinton_Rossiter">Clinton Rossiter</a> portrays Adams not as a monarchist but a revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with the stability of monarchy to create "ordered liberty."</span> <span class="sentence">His 1790 <i>Discourses on Davila</i> published in the <i>Gazette of the United States</i> warned once again of the dangers of unbridled democracy.</span> <span class="sentence">Many of these attacks are considered to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to "crown himself king" and "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne."</span> <span class="sentence">However, Peter Shaw has argued that: "[T]he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats)...Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life."</span> <span class="sentence">In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:</span> <span class="sentence">According to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: <a class="link" href="./Political_science">practical study</a> of past and present governments, and <a class="link" href="./Scottish_Enlightenment">Scottish Enlightenment</a> thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams conclusion was that the great danger was that an <a class="link" href="./Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality.</span> <span class="sentence">To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Adams was raised a <a class="link" href="./Congregational_church">Congregationalist</a>, since his ancestors were Puritans.</span> <span class="sentence">According to biographer <a class="link" href="./David_McCullough">David McCullough</a>, "as his family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that."</span> <span class="sentence">In a letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World.</span> <span class="sentence">He believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense.</span> <span class="sentence">Everett (1966) concludes that "Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection.</span> <span class="sentence">Fielding (1940) argues that Adams' beliefs synthesized Puritan, <a class="link" href="./Deism">deist</a>, and <a class="link" href="./Humanism">humanist</a> concepts.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been <a class="link" href="./Revelation">revelatory</a>, but was being misinterpreted in the service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power.</span> <span class="sentence">Frazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology, "Adams clearly was not a deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe in miracles or God's providence. ... Adams, however, did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation."</span> <span class="sentence">Frazer further argues that Adams' "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism."</span> <span class="sentence">In 1796, Adams denounced <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Paine">Thomas Paine's</a> deistic criticisms of Christianity in <a class="link" href="./The_Age_of_Reason"><i>The Age of Reason</i></a>, saying, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will."</span> <span class="sentence">In his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals.</span> <span class="sentence">He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society.</span> <span class="sentence">He became a <a class="link" href="./Unitarianism">Unitarian</a>, rejecting the divinity of <a class="link" href="./Jesus">Jesus</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">David L. Holmes argued that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of <a class="link" href="./Miracles_of_Jesus">his miracles</a> as true.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Franklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, "He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses."</span> <span class="sentence">Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and spotless career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history.</span> <span class="sentence">These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders.</span> <span class="sentence">Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.</span> <span class="sentence">He was often described as "prickly," but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: "[As president] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore."</span> <span class="sentence">Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology.</span> <span class="sentence">"Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right," he wrote.</span> <span class="sentence">His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.</span> <span class="sentence">Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Ferling, Adams' political philosophy was "out of step" with the way that the country was heading.</span> <span class="sentence">The country tended further away from Adams' views of order and the rule of law and towards Jeffersonian ideas about liberty and weak central government.</span> <span class="sentence">In the years following his retirement from public life, as first <a class="link" href="./Jeffersonian_democracy">Jeffersonianism</a> and then <a class="link" href="./Jacksonian_democracy">Jacksonian democracy</a> grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten.</span> <span class="sentence">When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way.</span> <span class="sentence">In the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1840">1840 presidential election</a>, <a class="link" href="./Whig_Party_(United_States)">Whig</a> candidate <a class="link" href="./William_Henry_Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> was attacked by <a class="link" href="./Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democrats</a> on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams was eventually subject to criticism from <a class="link" href="./States'_rights">states' rights</a> advocates.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Edward_A._Pollard">Edward A. Pollard</a>, a strong supported of the <a class="link" href="./Confederate_States_of_America">Confederacy</a> during the <a class="link" href="./American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a>, singled out Adams, writing:</span> <span class="sentence">In the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers.</span> <span class="sentence">McCullough argued that "[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him."</span> <span class="sentence">Todd Leopold of <a class="link" href="./CNN">CNN</a> wrote in 2001 that Adams is "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues."</span> <span class="sentence">He has always been seen, Ferling says, as "honest and dedicated," but despite his lengthy career in public service, is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries.</span> <span class="sentence">Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow."</span> <span class="sentence">In his 2-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling says that the man who emerges is one "perpetually at war with himself," whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity.</span> <span class="sentence">Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that "Adams was his own worst enemy."</span> <span class="sentence">He criticizes him for his "pettiness...jealousy, and vanity," and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children.</span> <span class="sentence">He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them.</span> <span class="sentence">In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled <a class="link" href="./John_Adams_(book)"><i>John Adams</i></a>.</span> <span class="sentence">McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, "plays down or explains away" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson.</span> <span class="sentence">The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams' reputation.</span> <span class="sentence">In 2008, a <a class="link" href="./John_Adams_(miniseries)">miniseries</a> was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring <a class="link" href="./Paul_Giamatti">Paul Giamatti</a> as Adams.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Adams is commemorated as the namesake of various counties, buildings, and other items.</span> <span class="sentence">One example is the <a class="link" href="./John_Adams_Building">John Adams Building</a> of the Library of Congress, an institution whose existence Adams had signed into law.</span> <span class="sentence">Unlike many other Founders, Adams does not have a monument dedicated to himself in Washington D.C. According to McCullough, "Popular symbolism has not been very generous toward Adams. There is no memorial, no statue...in his honor in our nation's capital, and to me that is absolutely inexcusable. It's long past time when we should recognize what he did, and who he was."</span>
