    <span class="sentence">President Kennedy had submitted a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which was met with strong opposition.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill.</span> <span class="sentence">This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Robert_Caro">Robert Caro</a> notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote.</span> <span class="sentence">In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it. Johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier.</span> <span class="sentence">In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil-rights bill was withdrawn.</span> <span class="sentence">Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process.</span> <span class="sentence">By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.</span> <span class="sentence">Passing the civil rights bill in the House required getting it through the <a class="link" href="./United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules">Rules Committee</a>, which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a <a class="link" href="./Discharge_petition">discharge petition</a> to force it onto the House floor.</span> <span class="sentence">Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110.</span> <span class="sentence">In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the <a class="link" href="./Filibuster">filibuster</a> as their only remaining tool.</span> <span class="sentence">Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Caro, it was ultimately Johnson's ability to convince Republican leader <a class="link" href="./Everett_Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a> to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71–29.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson signed the fortified <a class="link" href="./Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> into law on July 2.</span> <span class="sentence">Legend has it that the evening after signing the bill, Johnson told an aide, "I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.</span> <span class="sentence">Biographer Randall B. Woods has argued that Johnson effectively used appeals to <a class="link" href="./Judeo-Christian_ethics">Judeo-Christian ethics</a> to garner support for the civil rights law.</span> <span class="sentence">Woods writes that Johnson undermined the Southern filibuster against the bill:</span> <span class="sentence">Woods states that Johnson's religiosity ran deep: "At 15 he joined the Disciples of Christ, or Christian, church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor, the strong to assist the weak, and the educated to speak for the inarticulate."</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor, FDR, in that he paired liberal values to religious values, believing that freedom and social justice served both God and man.</span>

    <span class="sentence">In Spring 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right.</span> <span class="sentence">A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of <a class="link" href="./Featherbedding">featherbedding</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike.</span> <span class="sentence">After considerable horse trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS, Johnson got an agreement.</span> <span class="sentence">This substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image.</span> <span class="sentence">That same year, Robert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration.</span> <span class="sentence">Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate.</span> <span class="sentence">Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.</span> <span class="sentence">In preparation for the Democratic convention, Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor.</span> <span class="sentence">The squad's focus narrowed upon the <a class="link" href="./Mississippi_Freedom_Democratic_Party">Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party</a> (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state.</span> <span class="sentence">The squad's activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the <a class="link" href="./Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC) and the <a class="link" href="./Congress_of_Racial_Equality">Congress of Racial Equality</a> (CORE).</span> <span class="sentence">From beginning to end, the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.</span> <span class="sentence">In fact, Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem.</span> <span class="sentence">The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to "bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color."</span> <span class="sentence">The MFDP rejected the committee's ruling.</span> <span class="sentence">The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman <a class="link" href="./John_Lewis_(Georgia_politician)">John Lewis</a> would call it a "turning point in the civil rights movement."</span> <span class="sentence">Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act.</span> <span class="sentence">However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed.</span> <span class="sentence">On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the "<a class="link" href="./Daisy_(television_commercial)">Daisy ad</a>".</span> <span class="sentence">It portrayed a little girl picking petals from a <a class="link" href="./Common_Daisy">daisy</a>, counting up to ten.</span> <span class="sentence">Then a baritone voice took over, counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb.</span> <span class="sentence">The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war.</span> <span class="sentence">Goldwater's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming "In your heart, you know he's right.".</span> <span class="sentence">Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers that said "In your heart, you know he might" and "In your gut, you know he's nuts".</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05 percent of the vote, making it the highest ever share of the popular vote.</span> <span class="sentence">At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century—more than 15.95 million votes—this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1972">1972</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In the <a class="link" href="./Electoral_College_(United_States)">Electoral College</a>, Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's six.</span> <span class="sentence">Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936—a Senate with a 68–32 majority and a house with a 295–140 Democratic margin.</span>

The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation."</span> <span class="sentence">In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the <a class="link" href="./Voting_Rights_Act">Voting Rights Act</a>, which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time.</span> <span class="sentence">In accordance with the act, several states, "seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy" (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia) were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965 while Texas, then home to the largest African American population of any state, followed in 1975.</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77–19 just after 2 1/2 months and won passage in the house in July, by 333–85.</span> <span class="sentence">The results were significant—between the years of 1968 and 1980, the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled.</span> <span class="sentence">The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally—in 1965, a few hundred black office-holders mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989.</span> <span class="sentence">After the murder of civil rights worker <a class="link" href="./Viola_Liuzzo">Viola Liuzzo</a>, Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four <a class="link" href="./Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>smen implicated in her death.</span> <span class="sentence">He angrily denounced the Klan as a "hooded society of bigots," and warned them to "return to a decent society before it's too late."</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since <a class="link" href="./Ulysses_S._Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> about 93 years earlier.</span> <span class="sentence">He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South.</span> <span class="sentence">At the <a class="link" href="./Howard_University">Howard University</a> commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve goals, "To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice, but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin.

    <span class="sentence">In 1966 the press sensed a "<a class="link" href="./Credibility_gap">credibility gap</a>" between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in Vietnam, which led to much less favorable coverage.</span> <span class="sentence">By year's end, the Democratic governor of <a class="link" href="./Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a class="link" href="./Warren_E._Hearnes">Warren E.

    <span class="sentence">Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat; also, the <a class="link" href="./Viet_Cong">Viet Cong</a> had just killed eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at <a class="link" href="./Pleiku_Air_Base">Pleiku Air Base</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The eight-week bombing campaign became known as <a class="link" href="./Operation_Rolling_Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear—there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded.</span> <span class="sentence">Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war.</span> <span class="sentence">But the short-term expectations were consistent - that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered.</span> <span class="sentence">By limiting the information given out to the public and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.</span> <span class="sentence">In March, Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces—American air operations alone he counseled would not stop Hanoi's aggression against the South.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000, the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions—and most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; nevertheless, he disobligingly continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy.</span> <span class="sentence">By the middle of June, the total US ground forces in Vietnam were increased to 82,000 or by 150 percent.</span> <span class="sentence">That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective, and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse.</span> <span class="sentence">Gen. Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000.</span> <span class="sentence">After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists.</span> <span class="sentence">If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached.</span> <span class="sentence">He continued to insist that his decision "did not imply any change in policy whatsoever".</span> <span class="sentence">Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, "If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in the center of her forehead, you don't keep her in the living room".</span> <span class="sentence">By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.</span>

    <span class="sentence">January and February 1967 included probes to detect North Vietnamese willingness to discuss peace, and all fell on deaf ears.</span> <span class="sentence">Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the U.S. A Gallup poll taken in July 1967 showed 52 percent of the country disapproving of the president's handling of the war and only 34 percent thought progress was being made.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, "I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months", he shouted.</span> <span class="sentence">"You'll be dead politically in six months".</span> <span class="sentence">McNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May; the administration could declare its objective in the war—South Vietnam's self-determination—was being achieved and upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government.</span> <span class="sentence">The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome.</span> <span class="sentence">But Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports, again of questionable reliability, which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope of improvement.</span> <span class="sentence">The CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.</span> <span class="sentence">By the middle of 1967 nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war.</span> <span class="sentence">In July, Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future.</span> <span class="sentence">At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a "stalemate".</span> <span class="sentence">Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that "we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes".</span> <span class="sentence">Though Westmoreland sought many more, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000.</span> <span class="sentence">In August Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list.</span> <span class="sentence">In September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation, so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi; this was met with dissatisfaction.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson in a Texas speech agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt; this was named the "San Antonio" formula.</span> <span class="sentence">There was no response, but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause.</span> <span class="sentence">With the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict, Johnson convened a group called the "Wise Men" for a fresh, in-depth look at the war—Dean Acheson, Gen. Omar Bradley, George Ball, Mac Bundy, Arthur Dean, Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Murphy and Max Taylor.</span> <span class="sentence">At that time McNamara, reversing his position on the war, recommended that a cap of 525,000 be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted, since he could see no success.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and McNamara's resignation soon followed.</span> <span class="sentence">With the exception of George Ball, the "Wise Men" all agreed the administration should "press forward".</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 US election results before deciding to negotiate.</span> <span class="sentence">On June 23, 1967, Johnson traveled to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser.</span> <span class="sentence">Thousands of <a class="link" href="./Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War">anti-war protesters</a> tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking.</span> <span class="sentence">The march was led by a coalition of peace protestors.</span> <span class="sentence">However, a small group of <a class="link" href="./Progressive_Labor_Party_(United_States)">Progressive Labor Party</a> and <a class="link" href="./Students_for_a_Democratic_Society">SDS</a> protestors activists placed themselves at the head of the march and, when they reached the hotel, staged a sit-down.</span> <span class="sentence">Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful.</span> <span class="sentence">Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd.</span> <span class="sentence">The <a class="link" href="./Riot_Act">Riot Act</a> was read and 51 protestors arrested.</span> <span class="sentence">This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles.</span> <span class="sentence">Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed.</span> <span class="sentence">Due to the size and violence of this event, Johnson attempted no further public speeches in venues outside military bases.</span> <span class="sentence">With the ever-increasing public protests against the war, in October Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate, monitor and undermine anti-war activists.</span> <span class="sentence">In mid-October there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Johnson and Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, which was refuted by CIA findings.</span>
