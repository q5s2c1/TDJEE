It would also toughen the <a class="link" href="./Fugitive_Slave_Act_(1793)">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, as resistance to enforcement in parts of the North was a longtime Southern grievance.</span> <span class="sentence">Clay's bill provided for the settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary dispute; the status of slavery in the territories would be decided by those living there (known as <a class="link" href="./Popular_sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a>).</span> <span class="sentence">Taylor was unenthusiastic about the bill, and it languished in Congress, but Fillmore, after hearing weeks of debate, in May 1850 informed Taylor that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.</span> <span class="sentence">He did his best to keep the peace among the senators, reminding them of the vice president's power to rule them out of order, but was blamed for failing to maintain it when a physical confrontation between Mississippi's <a class="link" href="./Henry_S._Foote">Henry S. Foote</a> and Missouri's <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Hart_Benton_(politician)">Thomas Hart Benton</a> broke out on April 17—before other senators intervened to separate them, Foote pointed a gun at his colleague as Benton advanced on him.</span>

    <span class="sentence">July 4, 1850 was a very hot day in Washington, and President Taylor, who attended <a class="link" href="./Fourth_of_July">Fourth of July</a> ceremonies, refreshed himself, likely with cold milk and cherries.</span> <span class="sentence">What he consumed probably gave him <a class="link" href="./Gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a>, and he died on July 9.</span> <span class="sentence">Taylor, nicknamed "Old Rough and Ready", had gained a reputation for toughness through his military campaigning in the heat, and his sudden death came as a shock to the nation.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore had been called from his chair presiding over the Senate on July 8, and had sat with members of the cabinet in a vigil outside Taylor's bedroom at the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">He received the formal notification of the president's death, signed by the cabinet, on the evening of July 9 in his residence at the <a class="link" href="./Willard_Hotel">Willard Hotel</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">After acknowledging the letter, and spending a sleepless night, Fillmore went to the House of Representatives, where, at a <a class="link" href="./Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress">joint session of Congress</a>, he took the oath as president from <a class="link" href="./William_Cranch">William Cranch</a>, chief judge of <a class="link" href="./United_States_Circuit_Court_of_the_District_of_Columbia">the federal court for the District of Columbia</a>, and the man who had sworn in President Tyler.</span> <span class="sentence">The cabinet officers, as was customary when a new president took over, submitted their resignations, expecting Fillmore to refuse, allowing them to continue in office.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore had been marginalized by the cabinet members, and the new president accepted the resignations, though he asked them to stay on for a month, which most refused to do. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet.</span> <span class="sentence">He was already in discussions with Whig leaders, and on July 20 began to send new nominations to the Senate, with the Fillmore cabinet to be led by Webster as Secretary of State.</span> <span class="sentence">Webster had outraged his Massachusetts constituents by supporting Clay's bill, and with his Senate term to expire in 1851, had no electoral future in his home state.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore appointed his old law partner, Nathan Hall, as <a class="link" href="./Postmaster_General_of_the_United_States">Postmaster General</a>, a cabinet position that controlled many patronage appointments.</span> <span class="sentence">The new department heads were mostly supporters of the Compromise, as was Fillmore.</span> <span class="sentence">The brief pause from politics out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis.</span> <span class="sentence">Texas had attempted to assert its authority in New Mexico territory, and the state's governor, <a class="link" href="./Peter_H._Bell">Peter H. Bell</a>, had sent belligerent letters to President Taylor.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore received another such after becoming president.</span> <span class="sentence">He reinforced federal troops in the area, and warned Bell to keep the peace.</span> <span class="sentence">By July 31, Clay's bill was effectively dead, as all the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag put it that the "Mormons" were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus.</span> <span class="sentence">Illinois Senator <a class="link" href="./Stephen_A._Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> then stepped to the fore, with Clay's agreement, proposing to break the Omnibus into individual bills that could be passed piecemeal.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore endorsed this strategy, with the Omnibus to become (as it proved) five bills.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore sent a special message to Congress on August 6, 1850, disclosing the letter from Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise.</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate was without the <a class="link" href="./Great_Triumvirate">Great Triumvirate</a> of <a class="link" href="./John_C._Calhoun">John C.

    <span class="sentence">The Fugitive Slave Act was also the root of contention after its enactment: Southerners complained bitterly about any leniency in its application, but its enforcement was highly offensive to many Northerners.</span> <span class="sentence">Abolitionists recited the inequities of the law: it punished severely anyone aiding an escaped slave, and it granted no due process to the escapee, who could not testify before a magistrate.</span> <span class="sentence">The law also permitted higher payment to the hearing magistrate for deciding the escapee was a slave rather than free.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, Fillmore believed himself bound by his oath as president and by the bargain made in the Compromise to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act.</span> <span class="sentence">He did so even though some prosecutions or attempts to return slaves ended badly for the government, with acquittals or <a class="link" href="./Shadrach_Minkins">the slave taken from federal custody and freed by a Boston mob</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Such cases were widely publicized North and South, and inflamed passions in both places, undermining the good feeling that had followed the Compromise.</span> <span class="sentence">In August 1850, the social reformer <a class="link" href="./Dorothea_Dix">Dorothea Dix</a> wrote to Fillmore, urging support of her proposal in Congress for land grants to finance asylums for the impoverished mentally ill. Though her proposal did not pass, they became friends, meeting in person and corresponding, continuing well after Fillmore's presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">In September of that year, Fillmore appointed <a class="link" href="./Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> leader <a class="link" href="./Brigham_Young">Brigham Young</a> as the first governor of <a class="link" href="./Utah_Territory">Utah Territory</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In gratitude, Young named the first territorial capital "<a class="link" href="./Fillmore,_Utah">Fillmore</a>" and the surrounding county "<a class="link" href="./Millard_County,_Utah">Millard</a>".</span> <span class="sentence">A longtime supporter of national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills to subsidize the <a class="link" href="./Illinois_Central">Illinois Central</a> railroad from Chicago to <a class="link" href="./Mobile,_Alabama">Mobile</a>, and for <a class="link" href="./Soo_Locks">a canal</a> at <a class="link" href="./Sault_Ste._Marie,_Michigan">Sault Ste.

several <a class="link" href="./Nativism_(politics)">nativist</a> organizations, including the <a class="link" href="./Order_of_the_Star_Spangled_Banner">Order of the Star Spangled Banner</a>, sprang up in reaction.</span> <span class="sentence">By 1854, the Order had morphed into the American Party, which became known as the <a class="link" href="./Know_Nothings">Know Nothings</a>—in its early days, members were sworn to keep its internal deliberations private, and if asked, were to say they knew nothing about them.</span> <span class="sentence">Many from Fillmore's "National Whig" faction had joined the Know Nothings by 1854, and influenced the organization to take up causes besides nativism.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore was encouraged by the success of the Know Nothings in the 1854 midterm elections, in which they won in several Northeastern states and showed strength in the South.</span> <span class="sentence">On January 1, 1855, he sent a letter for publication, warning against immigrant influence in American elections, and soon thereafter joined the Order of the Star Spangled Banner.</span> <span class="sentence">Later that year, Fillmore went abroad, stating publicly that as he lacked office, he might as well travel.</span> <span class="sentence">The trip was at the advice of political friends, who felt that by touring, he would avoid involvement in the contentious issues of the day, and he spent over a year, from March 1855 to June 1856, in Europe and the Middle East.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> is said to have pronounced the ex-president the handsomest man she had ever seen, and his coincidental appearance with Van Buren in the gallery of the <a class="link" href="./House_of_Commons">House of Commons</a> triggered a comment from MP <a class="link" href="./John_Bright">John Bright</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore was offered an <a class="link" href="./Honorary_doctorate">honorary</a> <a class="link" href="./Doctor_of_Civil_Law">Doctor of Civil Law</a> (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford; he declined, explaining that he had neither the "literary nor scientific attainment" to justify the degree.</span> <span class="sentence">He is also quoted, that he "lacked the benefit of a classical education" and could not, therefore, understand the <a class="link" href="./Latin">Latin</a> text of the diploma, adding that he believed "no man should accept a degree he cannot read."</span> <span class="sentence">Alternatively, Fillmore may have refused the degree to escape the heckling and taunting which Oxford students typically imposed upon the recipients of such honors.</span> <span class="sentence">Dorothea Dix had preceded him to Europe, and was lobbying to improve conditions for the mentally ill. They continued to correspond, and met several times.</span> <span class="sentence">In Rome, Fillmore had <a class="link" href="./Audience_(meeting)#Papal audiences">an audience</a> with <a class="link" href="./Pope_Pius_IX">Pope Pius IX</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">He carefully weighed the political pros and cons of meeting with Pius; he nearly withdrew from the meeting when told he would have to kneel and kiss the pope's hand.</span> <span class="sentence">To avoid this, Pius remained seated throughout the meeting.</span>

Frémont</a>, who had no support in the South, would divide the Union and lead to civil war.</span> <span class="sentence">Both Fillmore and the Democratic candidate, former Pennsylvania senator <a class="link" href="./James_Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, agreed that slavery was principally a matter for state and not federal government.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore rarely spoke about the immigration question, and focused on the sectional divide, urging preservation of the Union.</span> <span class="sentence">Once Fillmore was back home in Buffalo, he had no excuse to make speeches, and his campaign stagnated through the summer and fall of 1856.</span> <span class="sentence">Political fixers who had been Whigs, such as Weed, tended to join the Republican Party, and the Know Nothings lacked experience at selling anything but nativism.</span> <span class="sentence">Accordingly, Fillmore's pro-Union stance fell mostly went unheard.</span> <span class="sentence">Although the South was friendly towards Fillmore, many there feared a Frémont victory would lead to secession, and some sympathetic to Fillmore moved into the Buchanan camp lest the anti-Frémont vote be split, which might elect the Republican.</span> <span class="sentence">Scarry suggested that the events of 1856, including <a class="link" href="./Bleeding_Kansas">the conflict</a> in <a class="link" href="./Kansas_Territory">Kansas Territory</a> and the <a class="link" href="./Caning_of_Charles_Sumner">caning of Charles Sumner</a> on the floor of the Senate, polarized the nation, making Fillmore's moderate stance obsolete.</span> <span class="sentence">On Election Day, Buchanan won with 1,836,072 votes (45.3%) and 174 electoral votes to Frémont's 1,342,345 votes (33.1%) and 114 electoral votes.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore and Donelson finished third, winning 873,053 votes (21.6%) and carrying the state of Maryland and its 8 electoral votes.</span> <span class="sentence">The American Party ticket narrowly lost in several southern states, and a change of fewer than 8,000 votes in Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee would have thrown the election to the House of Representatives, where the sectional divide would have made the outcome uncertain.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Allan_Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> wrote that Fillmore was not a Know Nothing or a nativist.</span> <span class="sentence">He was out of the country when the nomination came and had not been consulted about running.</span> <span class="sentence">Furthermore, "By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American tenets."</span> <span class="sentence">He sought national unity and felt the American Party was the "only hope of forming a truly national party, which shall ignore this constant and distracting agitation of slavery."</span>

    <span class="sentence">According to biographer Scarry: "No president of the United States ... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore".</span> <span class="sentence">He ascribed much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents who served in the years just prior to the Civil War as lacking in leadership.</span> <span class="sentence">For example, later president <a class="link" href="./Harry_S._Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> "characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial thumb-twaddler who would do nothing to offend anyone", and responsible in part for the war.</span> <span class="sentence">Anna Prior, writing in <a class="link" href="./The_Wall_Street_Journal"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a> in 2010, stated that Fillmore's very name connotes mediocrity.</span> <span class="sentence">Another Fillmore biographer, Finkelman, commented, "on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse ... in the end, Fillmore was always on the wrong side of the great moral and political issues".</span> <span class="sentence">Rayback, however, applauded "the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union".</span> <span class="sentence">Although Fillmore has become something of a cult figure as America's most forgettable chief executive, Smith found him to be "a conscientious president" who chose to honor his oath of office and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, rather than govern based on his personal preferences.</span> <span class="sentence">Paul G. Calabresi and <a class="link" href="./Christopher_S._Yoo">Christopher S. Yoo</a>, in their study of presidential power, deemed Fillmore "a faithful executor of the laws of the United States—for good and for ill".</span> <span class="sentence">But, according to Smith, the enforcement of the act has given Fillmore an undeserved pro-southern reputation.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore's place in history has also suffered because "even those who give him high marks for his support of the compromise have done so almost grudgingly, probably because of his Know-Nothing candidacy in 1856".</span> <span class="sentence">Smith argued that Fillmore's association with the Know Nothings looks far worse in retrospect than it did at the time, and that the former president was not motivated by nativism in his candidacy.</span> <span class="sentence">Benson Lee Grayson suggested that the Fillmore administration's ability to avoid potential problems is too often overlooked.</span> <span class="sentence">Fillmore's constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption of the war and laid the groundwork for the <a class="link" href="./Gadsden_Purchase">Gadsden Treaty</a> during Pierce's presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Meanwhile, the Fillmore administration resolved a controversy with Portugal left over from the Taylor administration, smoothed over a disagreement with Peru over <a class="link" href="./List_of_Guano_Island_claims">guano island</a>s, and peacefully resolved disputes with Britain, France, and Spain over Cuba.</span> <span class="sentence">All of these crises were resolved without the United States going to war or losing face.</span> <span class="sentence">Grayson also applauded Fillmore's firm stand against Texas' ambitions in New Mexico during the 1850 crisis.</span> <span class="sentence">Fred I. Greenstein and Dale Anderson praised Fillmore for his resoluteness in his early months in office, noting that Fillmore "is typically described as stolid, bland, and conventional, but such terms underestimate the forcefulness evinced by his handling of the Texas–New Mexico border crisis, his decision to replace Taylor's entire cabinet, and his effectiveness in advancing the Compromise of 1850".</span> <span class="sentence">Millard Fillmore, with his wife Abigail, established the first White House library.</span> <span class="sentence">There are a number of remembrances of Millard Fillmore; his East Aurora house still stands, and sites honor him at his birthplace and boyhood home (where a replica log cabin was dedicated in 1963 by the Millard Fillmore Memorial Association.) A statue of Fillmore stands outside Buffalo City Hall.</span> <span class="sentence">At the university he helped found, now <a class="link" href="./SUNY_Buffalo">SUNY Buffalo</a>, Millard Fillmore Academic Center and Millard Fillmore College bear his name.</span> <span class="sentence">On February 18, 2010, the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Mint">United States Mint</a> released the thirteenth coin in the <a class="link" href="./Presidential_$1_Coin_Program">Presidential $1 Coin Program</a>, bearing Fillmore's likeness.</span> <span class="sentence">According to the assessment of Fillmore by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia:</span>
