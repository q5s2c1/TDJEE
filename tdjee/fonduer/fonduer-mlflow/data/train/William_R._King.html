"Miss Nancy" was "a fairly common designation for people who wore clean clothes and had good manners"; and noted that Aaron Brown was a political enemy of King. James Loewen has described Buchanan and King as "siamese twins".

I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone, and [I] should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection."</span> <span class="sentence">After King died in 1853 Buchanan described him as "among the best, the purest and most consistent public men I have known."</span> <span class="sentence">While some of their correspondence were destroyed by family members, the length and intimacy of surviving letters illustrate "the affection of a special friendship".</span>

  <li>In 1852, the Oregon Territorial Legislature named King County for him. King County became part of Washington Territory when it was created the following year.

  <li>The King Residence Quadrangle at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, his alma mater, is named for him.</li>
  <li>An 1830 portrait of King is held at New East Hall in the Philanthropic Chambers by the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, a debating society which he had joined during college.</li>
  <li>King was a co-founder of (and named) Selma, a town on the Alabama River which he named after the Ossianic poem "The Songs of Selma". After his death, city officials and some of King's family wanted to move his body to Selma. Other family members wanted his body to remain at "Chestnut Hill". In 1882, the Selma City Council appointed a committee to select a new plot for King's body. His remains were then reinterred in the city's Live Oak Cemetery under a white marble mausoleum erected by the city.</li>
