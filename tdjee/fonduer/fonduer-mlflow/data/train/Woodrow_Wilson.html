Should we not, on the one hand, give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president, and the president, on the other hand, a better chance to approve himself a statesman, and his advisers capable men of affairs, in the guidance of Congress."</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's first political work, <i>Congressional Government</i> (1885), advocated a parliamentary system.</span> <span class="sentence">He critically described the United States government, with frequent negative comparisons to <a class="link" href="./Westminster_system">Westminster</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Critics contended the book was written without the benefit of the author observing any operational aspect of the U.S. Congress, and supporters asserted the work was the product of the imagination of a future statesman.</span> <span class="sentence">The book reflected the greater power of the legislature, relative to the executive, during the post-bellum period.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson later became a regular contributor to <a class="link" href="./Political_Science_Quarterly"><i>Political Science Quarterly</i></a>, an academic journal.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's second publication in 1890 was a textbook, entitled <i>The State</i>, used widely in college courses throughout the country until the 1920s.</span> <span class="sentence">He argued that government should not be deemed evil and advocated the use of government to allay social ills and advance society's welfare.</span> <span class="sentence">in 1889 Wilson contributed to a U.S. historical series, covering the period from President <a class="link" href="./Andrew_Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> through Reconstruction.</span> <span class="sentence">His third book, entitled <i>Division and Reunion</i>, was published in 1893 and considered an outstanding contribution to American historical writing.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's fourth publication, a five-volume work entitled <i>History of the American People</i>, was the culmination of a series of articles written for <a class="link" href="./<i>Harper's</i>">Harper's</a>, and was published in 1902.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1899, Wilson wrote in "The State" that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare "by forbidding child labor, by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories, by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to their health, by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold, by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades, [and] by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to out-do the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry."</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson believed that America's system of <a class="link" href="./Checks_and_balances">checks and balances</a> complicated American governance.</span> <span class="sentence">If government behaved badly, Wilson queried, "How is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?"</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson singled out the <a class="link" href="./United_States_House_of_Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> for particular criticism, saying,</span> <span class="sentence">divided up, as it were, into forty-seven seignories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the court-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor.</span> <span class="sentence">These petty barons, some of them not a little powerful, but none of them within reach [of] the full powers of rule, may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within their own shires, and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself.</span> <span class="sentence">In his last scholarly work, <i>Constitutional Government of the United States</i> (1908), Wilson said that the presidency "will be as big as and as influential as the man who occupies it."</span> <span class="sentence">By the time of his presidency, Wilson hoped that presidents could be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological, not geographic, lines.</span> <span class="sentence">He wrote, "Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties: No leaders, no principles; no principles, no parties."</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and "made the imperative legal duty of the whole," a position which, according to Robert M.

    <span class="sentence">In January 1910, Wilson had drawn the attention of New Jersey's former U.S. Senator James Smith, Jr. and <a class="link" href="./George_Brinton_McClellan_Harvey">George Harvey</a> as the potential Democratic standard bearer in the upcoming gubernatorial election.</span> <span class="sentence">On July 12, 1910 he was introduced to New Jersey's power players at the Lawyers Club in New York, including James Richard Nugent, Robert S. Hudspeth, Millard F. Ross, and Richard V. Lindabury.</span> <span class="sentence">The bosses had chosen their man, but his nomination was not a given—many, including organized labor, felt Wilson was an inexperienced newcomer.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, the bosses marshaled their forces at the party convention, and on September 14 Wilson was nominated, despite his endorsement of the local option on the liquor issue in opposition to his political machine.</span> <span class="sentence">He submitted his letter of resignation to Princeton on October 20. Wilson's opponent in the general election was the Republican candidate <a class="link" href="./Vivian_M._Lewis">Vivian M. Lewis</a>, the State Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's campaign focused on his promise to be independent of party bosses.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson quickly shed his professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking and presented himself as a full-fledged <a class="link" href="./Progressivism">progressive</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">He soundly defeated Lewis by a margin of more than 650,000 votes, although Republican <a class="link" href="./William_Howard_Taft">William Howard Taft</a> had carried New Jersey in the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1908">1908 presidential election</a> by more than 82,000 votes.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Edmund_Morris_(writer)">Edmund Morris</a> called Wilson a "dark horse" in the Governor's race.</span> <span class="sentence">He attributed the success of Wilson and others against the Taft Republicans in 1910 in part to the emergent national progressive message enunciated by <a class="link" href="./Theodore_Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> after his presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">In the 1910 election, the Democrats also took control of the <a class="link" href="./New_Jersey_General_Assembly">General Assembly</a>, though the <a class="link" href="./New_Jersey_Senate">State Senate</a> remained in Republican hands.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson appointed <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Patrick_Tumulty">Joseph Patrick Tumulty</a> as his private secretary, a position he held throughout Wilson's political career.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson began formulating his reformist agenda, intending to ignore the demands of his party machinery.</span> <span class="sentence">After Wilson's election, political boss (and former U.S. Senator) Smith asked Wilson to endorse his own reelection bid in the state legislature (this was before popular election of senators); Wilson refused and instead endorsed Smith's opponent <a class="link" href="./James_Edgar_Martine">James Edgar Martine</a>, who had won the primary.</span> <span class="sentence">When Martine won the seat, Wilson had positioned himself as a new force in the party in the state.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson concentrated on four major state reforms: changes in the election laws, a corrupt practices act, Workmen's Compensation, and establishment of a commission to regulate utilities.</span> <span class="sentence">The Geran bill, drafted by Elmer H. Geran, expanded public participation in primaries for all offices including party officials and delegates; it was thus directed at the power of the political bosses.</span> <span class="sentence">It passed the state assembly, albeit by a narrow margin.</span> <span class="sentence">The corrupt practices law and Workmen's Compensation statute soon followed.</span> <span class="sentence">A number of other reforms were realized during the remainder of Wilson's term as governor.</span> <span class="sentence">Free dental clinics were established, a "comprehensive and scientific" poor law was enacted, and the usage of common drinking cups was prohibited.</span> <span class="sentence">Trained nursing was also standardized, while contract labor in all reformatories and prisons was abolished, an indeterminate sentence act was passed, and regulation of weights and measures was carried out.</span> <span class="sentence">A law was introduced that compelled all railroad companies "to pay their employees twice monthly," while regulation of the working hours, health, safety, employment, and age of people employed in mercantile establishments was carried out.</span> <span class="sentence">Contract labor in penal institutions was abolished.</span> <span class="sentence">In addition, a law was passed extending the civil service "to employees of the State, counties, and municipalities," labor by women and children was limited, and oversight of factory working conditions was strengthened.</span> <span class="sentence">A new State Board of Education was also set up "with the power to conduct inspections and enforce standards, regulate districts' borrowing authority, and require special classes for students with handicaps."</span>

    <span class="sentence">After a vacation in Bermuda, Wilson was energized and more aggressive, even combative.</span> <span class="sentence">He noted the presidency was an office "in which a man must put on his war paint".</span> <span class="sentence">In Chicago, he addressed the Commercial Club, including some of the most powerful industrial and financial leaders of the Midwest; he emphasized his progressivism and called his audience to account for their malpractices in business affairs.</span> <span class="sentence">In his inaugural address Wilson reiterated his agenda for lower tariffs and banking reform, as well as aggressive trust and labor legislation.</span> <span class="sentence">The Wilsons decided against an inaugural ball and instead gathered with family and friends at the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">As the first Southerner elected to the presidency since 1848, Wilson inspired celebrations in the capital.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's demand for private reflection was evident when he immediately announced that office seekers were not permitted to visit the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">His decision-making style was to use solitude in conjunction with prevailing opinions in making decisions.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's personal staff reflected his preferences; Tumulty's position provided a political buffer and intermediary with the press, and his irrepressible spirits offset the president's often dour disposition.</span> <span class="sentence">Another close member of Wilson's personal staff was his physician, Navy medical officer Cary T. Grayson.</span> <span class="sentence">He became familiar with the president's medical history and confirmed his circulatory problem and hardening of the arteries.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson pioneered twice-weekly press conferences in the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">Though they were modestly effective, the president prohibited his being quoted and was particularly indeterminate in his statements.</span> <span class="sentence">The first such press conference was on March 15, 1913, when reporters were allowed to ask him questions.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1913, he became the first president to deliver the <a class="link" href="./State_of_the_Union_address">State of the Union address</a> in person since 1801, as <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> had discontinued this practice.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson was the first Democrat other than <a class="link" href="./Grover_Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> to be elected president since 1856, and he recognized his party's need for high-level federal patronage.</span> <span class="sentence">He worked closely with Southern Democrats.</span> <span class="sentence">In Wilson's first month in office, Postmaster General <a class="link" href="./Albert_S._Burleson">Albert S. Burleson</a> brought up the issue of racially segregating workplaces in a cabinet meeting and urged the president to establish this policy across the government, in restrooms, cafeterias and work spaces.</span> <span class="sentence">Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo also permitted lower-level officials to racially segregate employees in the workplaces of those departments.</span> <span class="sentence">By the end of 1913 many departments, including the Navy, had workspaces segregated by screens.</span> <span class="sentence">Restrooms and cafeterias were also segregated, although no executive order had been issued.</span> <span class="sentence">Segregation was urged by conservative groups, such as the <a class="link" href="./Fair_Play_Association">Fair Play Association</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson defended his administration's segregation policy in a July 1913 letter responding to <a class="link" href="./Oswald_Garrison_Villard">Oswald Garrison Villard</a>, publisher of the <a class="link" href="./New_York_Evening_Post"><i>New York Evening Post</i></a> and founding member of the <a class="link" href="./National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP); Wilson suggested that segregation removed "friction" between the <a class="link" href="./Race_(human_categorization)">races</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Ross Kennedy says that Wilson complied with predominant public opinion, but his change in federal practices was protested in letters from both blacks and whites to the White House, mass meetings, newspaper campaigns and official statements by both black and white church groups.</span> <span class="sentence">The president's African-American supporters, who had crossed party lines to vote for him, were bitterly disappointed, and they and Northern leaders protested the changes.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson continued to defend his policy, as in a letter to "prominent black minister Rev. H.A. Bridgman, editor of the Congregation and Christian World." Heckscher argues that Wilson had promised African Americans to deal generously with racial injustices, but did not deliver on these assurances.</span> <span class="sentence">Segregation in government offices and discriminatory hiring practices had been institutionalised by President Theodore Roosevelt and continued by President Taft; the Wilson administration continued and escalated these practices.</span> <span class="sentence">In an early foreign policy matter, Wilson responded to an angry protest by the Japanese government when the state of California proposed legislation that excluded Japanese people from land ownership in the state.</span> <span class="sentence">Japan's sense of humiliation remained high for decades to come.</span> <span class="sentence">In implementing economic policy, Wilson had to transcend the sharply opposing policy views of the Southern and agrarian wing of the Democratic Party led by Bryan, and the pro-business Northern wing led by urban political bosses.</span> <span class="sentence">In his Columbia University lectures of 1907, Wilson had said "the whole art of statesmanship is the art of bringing the several parts of government into effective cooperation for the accomplishment of particular common objects".</span> <span class="sentence">As he took up the first item of his "New Freedom" agenda—lowering the tariffs—he quite adroitly applied this artistry.</span> <span class="sentence">With large Democratic majorities in Congress and a healthy economy, Wilson seized the opportunity to achieve his agenda.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson also made quick work of realizing his pledges to beef up <a class="link" href="./Antitrust">antitrust</a> regulation and to bring reform to banking and currency matters.</span>

    <span class="sentence">From 1914 until early 1917, Wilson's primary objective was to keep America out of the <a class="link" href="./World_War_I">war in Europe</a>, and his policy was, "the true spirit of neutrality, which is the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned."</span> <span class="sentence">The president insisted that all government actions be neutral, and that the belligerents must respect that neutrality according to the norms of international law.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson told the Senate in August 1914 when the war began that the United States, "must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another."</span> <span class="sentence">He was ambiguous whether he meant the United States as a nation or meant all Americans as individuals.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson has been accused of violating his own rule of neutrality.</span> <span class="sentence">Later that month he explained himself privately to his top foreign policy advisor <a class="link" href="./Colonel_House">Colonel House</a>, who recalled the episode later:</span> <span class="sentence">: I was interested to hear him express as his opinion what I had written him some time ago in one of my letters, to the effect that if Germany won it would change the course of our civilization and make the United States a military nation.</span> <span class="sentence">He also spoke of his deep regret, as indeed I did to him in that same letter, that it would check his policy for a better international ethical code.</span> <span class="sentence">He felt deeply the destruction of Louvain [in Belgium], and I found him as unsympathetic with the German attitude as is the balance of America.</span> <span class="sentence">He goes even further than I in his condemnation of Germany's part in this war, and almost allows his feeling to include the German people as a whole rather than the leaders alone.</span> <span class="sentence">He said German philosophy was essentially selfish and lacking in spirituality.</span> <span class="sentence">When I spoke of the Kaiser building up the German machine as a means of maintaining peace, he said, "What a foolish thing it was to create a powder magazine and risk someone's dropping a spark into it!"</span> <span class="sentence">He thought the war would throw the world back three or four centuries.</span> <span class="sentence">I did not agree with him.</span> <span class="sentence">He was particularly scornful of Germany's disregard of treaty obligations, and was indignant at the German Chancellor's designation of the Belgian Treaty as being "only a scrap of paper" ... But although the personal feeling of the President was with the Allies, he insisted then and for many months after, that this ought not to affect his political attitude, which he intended should be one of strict neutrality.</span> <span class="sentence">He felt that he owed it to the world to prevent the spreading of the conflagration, that he owed it to the country to save it from the horrors of war.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson made numerous offers to mediate and sent <a class="link" href="./Colonel_House">Colonel House</a> on diplomatic missions; both sides politely dismissed these overtures.</span> <span class="sentence">When Britain <a class="link" href="./Blockade_of_Germany">declared a blockade</a> of neutral ships carrying contraband goods to Germany, Wilson mildly protested non-lethal British violations of neutral rights; the British knew that it would not be a <a class="link" href="./Casus_belli"><i>casus belli</i></a> for the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">In early 1915 Germany declared the waters around Great Britain to be a war zone; Wilson dispatched a note of protest, imposing "strict accountability" on Germany for the safety of neutral ships.</span> <span class="sentence">The meaning of the policy, dubiously applied to specific incidents, evolved with the policy of neutrality, but ultimately formed the substance of U.S. responses over the next two years.</span> <span class="sentence">The main crisis came when a German U-boat sank the British ocean liner RMS <i>Lusitania</i> in May 1915.</span> <span class="sentence">International law required a warning so that passengers and crew could board life boats.</span> <span class="sentence">No warning was issued and the ship sank in 18 minutes, with a thousand deaths including over 100 Americans.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson said, "There is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right".</span> <span class="sentence">Many reacted to these remarks with contempt.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson protested to Berlin, but its reply was evasive.</span> <span class="sentence">Secretary of State Bryan, strongly opposed to war, resigned and was replaced by <a class="link" href="./Robert_Lansing">Robert Lansing</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The White Star liner SS <i>Arabic</i> was then torpedoed, with two American casualties.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson threatened a diplomatic break unless Germany repudiated the action; Germany then gave a written promise: "liners will not be sunk by our submarines".</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson had won a promise that merchant ships would not be sunk without warning, and most importantly had kept the U.S. out of the war.</span> <span class="sentence">Meanwhile, Wilson requested and received funds in the final 1916 appropriations bill to provide for 500,000 troops.</span> <span class="sentence">It also included a five-year Navy plan for major construction of battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines—showing Wilson's dedication to a big Navy.</span> <span class="sentence">In March 1916 the SS <i>Sussex</i>, an unarmed ferry under the French flag, was torpedoed in the English Channel, and four Americans were counted among the dead; the Germans had flouted the post-<i>Lusitania</i> exchanges.</span> <span class="sentence">The president demanded the Germans reject their submarine tactics.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson drew praise when he succeeded in wringing from Germany a pledge to constrain their U-boat warfare to the rules of cruiser warfare.</span> <span class="sentence">This was a clear departure from existing practices—a diplomatic concession from which Germany could only more brazenly withdraw, and regrettably did.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson made a plea for postwar world peace in May 1916; his speech recited the right of every nation to its sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom from aggression.</span> <span class="sentence">"So sincerely do we believe these things", Wilson said, "that I am sure that I speak the mind and wish of the people of America when I say that the United States is willing to become a partner in any feasible association of nations formed in order to realize these objectives".</span> <span class="sentence">At home the speech was seen as a turning point in policy.</span> <span class="sentence">In Europe the words were received by the British and the French without comment.</span> <span class="sentence">His harshest European critics rightly thought the speech reflected indifference on Wilson's part; indeed, Wilson never wavered from a belief that the war was the result of corrupt European power politics.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson made his final offer to mediate peace on December 18, 1916.</span> <span class="sentence">As a preliminary, he asked both sides to state their minimum terms necessary for future security.</span> <span class="sentence">The <a class="link" href="./Central_Powers">Central Powers</a> replied that victory was certain, and the Allies required the dismemberment of their enemies' empires; no desire for peace existed, and the offer lapsed.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Wilson's remarriage rejuvenated his personal aspirations for re-election.</span> <span class="sentence">Edith Wilson enjoyed, as Ellen never had, the crowds and the power as a close collaborator with her husband.</span> <span class="sentence">Executive decisions just prior to the campaign also enabled Wilson to bolster his political mastery.</span> <span class="sentence">He was presented with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, which he succeeded in filling with a controversial nominee, <a class="link" href="./Louis_Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a>, the first Jewish member of the court.</span> <span class="sentence">Also, in the summer of 1916 the nation's economy was endangered by a railroad strike.</span> <span class="sentence">The president called the parties to a White House summit in August—after two days and no results, Wilson proceeded to settle the issue, using the maximum eight-hour work day as the linchpin.</span> <span class="sentence">Once the Congress passed the Adamson bill incorporating the president's proposal, the strike was cancelled.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster, though the law was received with howls from conservatives denouncing a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an imperious president.</span> <span class="sentence">In the campaign, McCombs was replaced as chairman of the Democratic Party by <a class="link" href="./Vance_C._McCormick">Vance C. McCormick</a>, a leading progressive, and Ambassador <a class="link" href="./Henry_Morgenthau,_Sr.">Henry Morgenthau</a> was recalled from Turkey to manage campaign finances.</span> <span class="sentence">"Colonel" House played an important role in the campaign.</span> <span class="sentence">"He planned its structure; set its tone; helped guide its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign's greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate."</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson, renominated without opposition, employed his campaign slogan "He kept us out of war", though he never promised unequivocally to stay out of the war.</span> <span class="sentence">In his acceptance speech on September 2, 1916, Wilson pointedly warned Germany that submarine warfare resulting in American deaths would not be tolerated, saying "The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance. It at once makes the quarrel in part our own."</span> <span class="sentence">As the Party platform was drafted, Senator Owen of Oklahoma urged Wilson to take ideas from the Progressive Party platform of 1912 "as a means of attaching to our party progressive Republicans who are in sympathy with us in so large a degree."</span> <span class="sentence">At Wilson's request, Owen highlighted federal legislation to promote workers' health and safety, prohibit child labour, provide <a class="link" href="./Unemployment_benefits">unemployment compensation</a> and establish minimum wages and maximum hours.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson, in turn, included in his draft platform a plank that called for all work performed by and for the federal government to provide a minimum wage, an eight-hour day and six-day workweek, health and safety measures, the prohibition of child labour, and (his own additions) safeguards for female workers and a retirement program.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson was also noted for his support of social insurance, such as government pensions to poor mothers.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's opponent was Republican <a class="link" href="./Charles_Evans_Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a>, former governor of New York with a progressive record similar to Wilson's as governor of New Jersey.</span> <span class="sentence">Theodore Roosevelt commented that the only thing different between Hughes and Wilson was a shave.</span> <span class="sentence">However, Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans, and his campaign never assumed a definite form.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes, reserving his attacks for Roosevelt.</span> <span class="sentence">When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly, Wilson told a friend, "Never murder a man who is committing suicide."</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./U.S._presidential_election,_1916">The election's</a> outcome was in doubt for several days and was determined by several close states.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson won <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election_in_California,_1916">California</a> by 3,773 of almost a million votes cast, and New Hampshire by 56 votes.</span> <span class="sentence">Hughes won <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election_in_Minnesota,_1916">Minnesota</a> by 393 votes out of over 358,000.</span> <span class="sentence">In the final count, Wilson had 277 electoral votes vs. Hughes' 254.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Teddy Roosevelt or <a class="link" href="./Eugene_V._Debs">Eugene V.

We shall not believe they are hostile to us unless or until we are obliged to believe it".</span> <span class="sentence">In March 1917 several American ships were sunk by Germany; the cabinet was unanimously in favor of war.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson delivered his <i>War Message</i> to a special session of Congress on April 2, 1917, declaring that Germany's latest pronouncement had rendered his "armed neutrality" policy untenable and asking Congress to declare Germany's war stance was an act of war.</span> <span class="sentence">He proposed the United States enter the war to "vindicate principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power".</span> <span class="sentence">The German government, Wilson said, "means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors".</span> <span class="sentence">He then also warned that "if there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with a firm hand of repression."</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson closed with:</span> <span class="sentence">After returning to the White House, Wilson sat alone in the <a class="link" href="./Cabinet_Room_(White_House)">Cabinet Room</a> with his aide <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Patrick_Tumulty">Joe Tumulty</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">"Think of what it was they were applauding," he told Tumulty.</span> <span class="sentence">"My message today was a message of death for our young men.

    <span class="sentence">Wilson was the first Southerner to be elected president since <a class="link" href="./Zachary_Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> in <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1848">1848</a>: his ascension to the presidency was thus celebrated by Southern segregationists.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson himself identified with the "<a class="link" href="./Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy">Lost Cause</a>" view of the Confederacy, which downplayed the importance of slavery to the Confederate cause, instead arguing that it was an attempt to defend a Southern agrarian way of life against Northern intrusion.</span> <span class="sentence">Several historians have spotlighted consistent examples in the public record of Wilson's overtly racist policies and political appointments, such as segregationists he placed in his cabinet.</span> <span class="sentence">According to scholars, Wilson believed that slavery was wrong on economic labor grounds, rather than for moral reasons.</span> <span class="sentence">They also argue that he idealized the slavery system in the South, viewing masters as patient with indolent slaves.</span> <span class="sentence">In terms of <a class="link" href="./Reconstruction_Era">Reconstruction</a>, Wilson held the common southern view that the South was demoralized by Northern <a class="link" href="./Carpetbaggers">carpetbaggers</a> and that overreach on the part of the <a class="link" href="./Radical_Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> justified extreme measures to reassert Democratic national and state governments.</span> <span class="sentence">While president of <a class="link" href="./Princeton_University">Princeton University</a>, Wilson had discouraged blacks from applying for admission, preferring to keep the peace among white students and alumni.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's <i>History of the American People</i> (1901) dismissed lynchings committed by the <a class="link" href="./Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> of the late 1860s as a lawless reaction to a lawless period.</span> <span class="sentence">The President defended them, writing that "[the Klan] began to attempt by intimidation what they were not allowed to attempt by the ballot or by any ordered course of public action".</span> <span class="sentence">The book also criticised Reconstruction as "the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race" and described granting voting rights to blacks as a "menace to society".</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson's War Department drafted hundreds of thousands of blacks into the army, giving them equal pay with whites, but in accord with military policy from the Civil War through the Second World War, kept them in all-black units with white officers, and kept the great majority out of combat.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1918, <a class="link" href="./W._E._B._Du_Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a>—a leader of the <a class="link" href="./NAACP">NAACP</a> who had campaigned for Wilson believing he was a "liberal southerner"—was offered an Army commission in charge of dealing with race relations; DuBois accepted, but he failed his Army physical and did not serve.</span> <span class="sentence">By 1916, Du Bois opposed Wilson, charging that his first term had seen "the worst attempt at Jim Crow legislation and discrimination in civil service that [blacks] had experienced since the Civil War."</span> <span class="sentence">During Wilson's presidency, the film <a class="link" href="./The_Birth_of_a_Nation"><i>The Birth of a Nation</i></a> (1915) became the first motion picture to be in screened in the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">It was adapted from <a class="link" href="./The_Clansman"><i>The Clansman</i></a>, by Wilson's old friend Thomas Dixon Jr. The film, while revolutionary in its cinematic technique, glorified the Ku Klux Klan and portrayed blacks as uncouth and uncivilized.</span> <span class="sentence">Three of Wilson's quotes were used for <a class="link" href="./Intertitle">intertitle</a>s in the film, one describing the Reconstruction as a time when "[A]dventurers swarmed out of the North ... to cozen, beguile, and use the Negroes.…In the villages the Negroes were the office holders, men who knew none of the uses of authority, except its insolences", another claiming that Congressional leaders of that time wanted to "put the white South under the heel of the black South", and a third suggesting that the Klan grew out of "the white men of the South (being) aroused by a mere instinct of self-preservation".</span> <span class="sentence">After seeing the film, Wilson felt betrayed by Dixon, and did not like or endorse the film.</span> <span class="sentence">Wilson tried to stop its showing during the World War.</span> <span class="sentence">Biographer Cooper rejects the allegation first made in 1937 by a magazine writer who said that Wilson remarked: "It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true"; an eyewitness reports that Wilson said nothing.</span> <span class="sentence">During Wilson's term, segregation was ordered in the Washington offices of the Navy, the Treasury, and the Postmaster General, and photographs became required for all new federal job applicants.</span> <span class="sentence">When a delegation of black professionals from the National Independent Political League, led by newspaper editor <a class="link" href="./William_Monroe_Trotter">William Monroe Trotter</a>, protested the discriminatory actions, Wilson told them "segregation is not a humiliation but a benefit, and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen", explained he was trying to "reduce friction," and that he "sincerely believe[d] it to be in their interest".</span> <span class="sentence">When Trotter countered by arguing that it was "untenable ... to maintain that the segregation is simply to avoid race friction" as black and white clerks had worked together harmoniously for fifty years, Wilson rebuked him, stating that if the League wanted to meet with him again "it must have another spokesman. Your manner offends me".</span> <span class="sentence">Trotter was then ordered to leave the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">Under Wilson, racial segregation was quickly implemented at the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Post_Office_Department">Post Office Department</a>, and many African-American employees were downgraded and even fired.</span> <span class="sentence">Employees who were downgraded were transferred to the <a class="link" href="./Dead_letter_office">dead letter office</a>, where they did not interact with the public.</span> <span class="sentence">The few African Americans who remained at the main post offices were put to work behind screens, out of customers' sight.</span> <span class="sentence">The Wilson administration's pro-segregation positions were criticised not only by black leaders, but by their white allies: journalist <a class="link" href="./Oswald_Garrison_Villard">Oswald Garrison Villard</a> suggested that the administration had "allied itself with the forces of reaction, and put itself on the side of every torturer, of every oppressor, of every perpetrator of racial injustice in the South or the North".</span> <span class="sentence">Although Villard subsequently corresponded with and met with Wilson about the issue, no change in policy was forthcoming.</span>
