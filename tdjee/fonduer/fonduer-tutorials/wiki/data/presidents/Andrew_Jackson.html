    <span class="sentence">After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814, Jackson instituted <a class="link" href="./Martial_law">martial law</a> in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's <a class="link" href="./Louisiana_Creole_people">Creole</a> and Spanish inhabitants.</span> <span class="sentence">At the same time, he formed an alliance with <a class="link" href="./Jean_Lafitte">Jean Lafitte's</a> smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary.</span> <span class="sentence">These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans.</span> <span class="sentence">The approaching British force, led by Admiral <a class="link" href="./Alexander_Cochrane">Alexander Cochrane</a> and later General <a class="link" href="./Edward_Pakenham">Edward Pakenham</a>, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson only had about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.</span> <span class="sentence">The British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the morning of December 23.

    <span class="sentence">In the spring of 1822, Jackson suffered a physical breakdown.</span> <span class="sentence">His body had two bullets lodged in it, and he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning.</span> <span class="sentence">He regularly coughed up blood, and his entire body shook.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson feared that he was on the brink of death.</span> <span class="sentence">After several months of rest, he recovered.</span> <span class="sentence">During his convalescence, Jackson's thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs.</span> <span class="sentence">He obsessed over rampant corruption in the Monroe administration and grew to detest the <a class="link" href="./Second_Bank_of_the_United_States">Second Bank of the United States</a>, blaming it for causing the <a class="link" href="./Panic_of_1819">Panic of 1819</a> by contracting credit.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state, but accepted <a class="link" href="./John_Overton_(judge)">John Overton's</a> plan to have the legislature nominate him for president.</span> <span class="sentence">On July 22, 1822, he was officially nominated by the Tennessee legislature.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson had come to dislike Secretary of the Treasury <a class="link" href="./William_H._Crawford">William H. Crawford</a>, who had been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford.</span> <span class="sentence">Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks.</span> <span class="sentence">The Panic of 1819 had devastated the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular.</span> <span class="sentence">With his growing political viability, Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates, along with Crawford, Adams, Clay, and <a class="link" href="./United_States_Secretary_of_War">Secretary of War</a> <a class="link" href="./John_C._Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">During the <a class="link" href="./Era_of_Good_Feelings">Era of Good Feelings</a>, the Federalist Party had faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of the Democratic-Republican Party.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson's campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions.</span> <span class="sentence">On the major issues of the day, most prominently the <a class="link" href="./Tariff_of_1824">tariff</a>, Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions.</span> <span class="sentence">At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats.</span> <span class="sentence">The move was independently orchestrated by his advisors <a class="link" href="./William_Berkeley_Lewis">William Berkeley Lewis</a> and U.S. Senator <a class="link" href="./John_Eaton_(politician)">John Eaton</a> in order to defeat incumbent <a class="link" href="./John_Williams_(Tennessee)">John Williams</a>, who openly opposed his presidential candidacy.</span> <span class="sentence">The legislature narrowly elected him.</span> <span class="sentence">His return, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.</span> <span class="sentence">Although Jackson was reluctant to serve once more in the Senate, he was appointed chairman of the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Armed_Services">Committee on Military Affairs</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Eaton wrote to Rachel that Jackson as a senator was "in harmony and good understanding with every body," including Thomas Hart Benton, now a senator from Missouri, with whom Jackson had fought in 1813.</span> <span class="sentence">Meanwhile, Jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency, as was customary.</span> <span class="sentence">Eaton updated an already-written biography of him in preparation for the campaign and, along with others, wrote letters to newspapers praising Jackson's record and past conduct.</span> <span class="sentence">Democratic-Republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal <a class="link" href="./Congressional_nominating_caucus">Congressional nominating caucus</a>es, but this method had become unpopular.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus.</span> <span class="sentence">Those who attended backed Crawford for president and <a class="link" href="./Albert_Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a> for vice president.</span> <span class="sentence">A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for president a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" in the "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate."</span> <span class="sentence">Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office."</span> <span class="sentence">After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.</span> <span class="sentence">In the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the <a class="link" href="./Electoral_College_(United_States)">electoral vote</a>, taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</span> <span class="sentence">He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidate, but still short of 131, which he needed for a true majority.</span> <span class="sentence">With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a <a class="link" href="./Contingent_election">contingent election</a> under the terms of the <a class="link" href="./Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Twelfth Amendment</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Clay, who as Speaker of the House presided over the election, saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership.</span> <span class="sentence">He threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally funded <a class="link" href="./Internal_improvement">internal improvement</a>s such as roads and canals.</span> <span class="sentence">With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot.</span> <span class="sentence">Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a "<a class="link" href="./Corrupt_bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" after Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.</span> <span class="sentence">"So you see," Jackson growled, "the Judas of the West has closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver. [H]is end will be the same."</span> <span class="sentence">After the election, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Almost immediately, opposition arose to the Adams presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson opposed Adams's plan to involve the U.S. in <a class="link" href="./Panama">Panama's</a> quest for independence, writing, "The moment we engage in confederations, or alliances with any nation, we may from that time date the down fall of our republic."</span> <span class="sentence">Adams also damaged his standing in his first annual message to Congress, when he argued that Congress must not give the world the impression "that we are palsied by the will of our constituents."</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election.</span> <span class="sentence">It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams's presidency floundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics.</span> <span class="sentence">Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power.</span> <span class="sentence">Senator <a class="link" href="./Martin_Van_Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in the 1824 election, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in the 1828 election.</span> <span class="sentence">Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who also opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds.</span> <span class="sentence">Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation.</span> <span class="sentence">In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote.</span> <span class="sentence">The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the <a class="link" href="./Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic Party</a> and Adams's followers became known as the <a class="link" href="./National_Republican_Party">National Republicans</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In the large Scots-Irish community that was especially numerous in the rural South and Southwest, Jackson was a favorite hero.</span> <span class="sentence">The campaign was very much a personal one.</span> <span class="sentence">As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events.</span> <span class="sentence">Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson was strongly attacked as a <a class="link" href="./Slave_trader">slave trader</a>, who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior.</span> <span class="sentence">A series of pamphlets known as the <a class="link" href="./Coffin_Handbills">Coffin Handbills</a> were published to attack Jackson, one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at New Orleans.</span> <span class="sentence">Another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of American Indians killed in battle, while still another labeled his mother a "common prostitute" and stated that Jackson's father was a "mulatto man."</span> <span class="sentence">Rachel Jackson was also a frequent target of attacks, and was widely accused of bigamy, a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson's campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as Minister to Russia, Adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for <a class="link" href="./Alexander_I_of_Russia">Emperor Alexander I</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">They also stated that Adams had a billiard table in the White House and that he had charged the government for it. Rachel had been under extreme stress during the election, and often struggled while Jackson was away.</span> <span class="sentence">She began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast."</span> <span class="sentence">After struggling for three days, Rachel finally died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828 three weeks after her husband's victory in the election (which began on October 31 and ended on December 2) and 10 weeks before Jackson took office as president.</span> <span class="sentence">A distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.</span> <span class="sentence">He felt that the accusations from Adams's supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him.</span> <span class="sentence">Rachel was buried at the Hermitage on Christmas Eve.</span> <span class="sentence">"May God Almighty forgive her murderers," Jackson swore at her funeral.</span> <span class="sentence">"I never can."</span>

    <span class="sentence">In 1837, after serving two terms as president, Jackson was replaced by his chosen successor Martin Van Buren and retired to the Hermitage.</span> <span class="sentence">He immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained highly influential in both national and state politics.</span> <span class="sentence">He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union."</span> <span class="sentence">Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to repudiate the Specie Circular as president.</span> <span class="sentence">As a solution to the panic, he supported an <a class="link" href="./Independent_Treasury">Independent Treasury</a> system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of <a class="link" href="./Hard_money_(policy)">gold or silver</a> and would be restricted from printing <a class="link" href="./Banknote">paper money</a> so as to prevent further <a class="link" href="./Inflation">inflation</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">A coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840.</span> <span class="sentence">During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression.</span> <span class="sentence">Van Buren grew deeply unpopular.</span> <span class="sentence">A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero <a class="link" href="./William_Henry_Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> and former Jacksonian John Tyler in the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1840">1840 presidential election</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats when Jackson ran.</span> <span class="sentence">They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a man of the people.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee.</span> <span class="sentence">He favored the nomination of Polk for vice president at the <a class="link" href="./1840_Democratic_National_Convention">1840 Democratic National Convention</a> over controversial incumbent <a class="link" href="./Richard_Mentor_Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">No nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.</span> <span class="sentence">Harrison won the election, and the Whigs captured majorities in both houses of Congress.</span> <span class="sentence">"The democracy of the United States has been shamefully beaten," Jackson wrote to Van Buren.</span> <span class="sentence">"but I trust, not conquered."</span> <span class="sentence">Harrison died only a month into his term, and was replaced by Tyler.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson was encouraged because Tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines.</span> <span class="sentence">Sure enough, Tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the Whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two Whig-sponsored bills to establish a new national bank, bringing satisfaction to Jackson and other Democrats.</span> <span class="sentence">After the second veto, Tyler's entire cabinet, with the exception of <a class="link" href="./Daniel_Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, resigned.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson strongly favored the <a class="link" href="./Texas_annexation">annexation of Texas</a>, a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">While Jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti-slavery sentiment, his belief that the British would use Texas as a base to threaten the United States overrode his other concerns.</span> <span class="sentence">He also insisted that Texas was part of the <a class="link" href="./Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> and therefore rightfully belonged to the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">At the request of Senator <a class="link" href="./Robert_J._Walker">Robert J. Walker</a> of Mississippi, acting on behalf of the Tyler administration, which also supported annexation, Jackson wrote several letters to Texas President <a class="link" href="./Sam_Houston">Sam Houston</a>, urging him to wait for the Senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the United States would benefit Texas.</span> <span class="sentence">Initially prior to the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1844">1844 election</a>, Jackson again supported Van Buren for president and Polk for vice president.</span> <span class="sentence">A treaty of annexation was signed by Tyler on April 12, 1844, and submitted to the Senate.</span> <span class="sentence">When a letter from Secretary of State Calhoun to British Ambassador <a class="link" href="./Richard_Pakenham">Richard Pakenham</a> linking annexation to slavery was made public, anti-annexation sentiment exploded in the North and the bill failed to be ratified.</span> <span class="sentence">Van Buren decided to write the "Hamlet letter," opposing annexation.</span> <span class="sentence">This effectively extinguished any support that Van Buren might previously have enjoyed in the South.</span> <span class="sentence">The Whig nominee, Henry Clay, also opposed annexation, and Jackson recognized the need for the Democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the South.</span> <span class="sentence">If the plan failed, Jackson warned, Texas would not join the Union and would potentially fall victim to a Mexican invasion supported by the British.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson met with Polk, <a class="link" href="./Robert_Armstrong_(1792–1854)">Robert Armstrong</a>, and Andrew Jackson Donelson in his study.</span> <span class="sentence">He then pointed directly at a startled Polk, telling him that, as a man from the southwest and a supporter of annexation, he would be the perfect candidate.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk called the scheme "utterly abortive," but agreed to go along with it. At the <a class="link" href="./1844_Democratic_National_Convention">1844 Democratic National Convention</a>, Polk emerged as the party's nominee after Van Buren failed to win the required two-thirds majority of delegates.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./George_M._Dallas">George M.

Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6 o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant. ... When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."</span> <span class="sentence">In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Jackson's quick temper was notorious.</span> <span class="sentence">Biographer <a class="link" href="./H._W._Brands">H. W. Brands</a> notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: "Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. ... His close associates all had stories of his blood-curdling oaths, his summoning of the Almighty to loose His wrath upon some miscreant, typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition. Given his record—in duels, brawls, mutiny trials, and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously."</span> <span class="sentence">On the last day of his presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun."</span> <span class="sentence">On his deathbed, he was once again quoted as regretting that he had not hanged Calhoun for treason.</span> <span class="sentence">"My country would have sustained me in the act, and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come," he said.</span> <span class="sentence">Remini expresses the opinion that Jackson was typically in control of his temper, and that he used his anger, along with his fearsome reputation, as a tool to get what he wanted.</span>

Schlesinger Jr.'s</a> <i>Age of Jackson</i> (1945) depicts Jackson as a man of the people battling inequality and upper-class tyranny.</span> <span class="sentence">From the 1970s to the 1980s, Robert Remini published a three-volume biography of Jackson followed by an abridged one-volume study.</span> <span class="sentence">Remini paints a generally favorable portrait of Jackson.</span> <span class="sentence">He contends that Jacksonian democracy "stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable. ... As such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in American history—<a class="link" href="./People's_Party_(United_States)">Populism</a>, <a class="link" href="./Progressive_Era">Progressivism</a>, the <a class="link" href="./New_Deal">New</a> and <a class="link" href="./Fair_Deal">Fair</a> Deals, and the programs of the <a class="link" href="./New_Frontier">New Frontier</a> and <a class="link" href="./Great_Society">Great Society</a>."</span> <span class="sentence">To Remini, Jackson serves as "the embodiment of the new American ... This new man was no longer British. He no longer wore the queue and silk pants.
