    <span class="sentence">Johnson helped organize a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election.</span> <span class="sentence">He was elected town alderman, along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln.</span> <span class="sentence">Following the 1831 <a class="link" href="./Nat_Turner's_slave_rebellion">Nat Turner slave rebellion</a>, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to <a class="link" href="./Disfranchisement">disenfranchise</a> free people of color.</span> <span class="sentence">The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure.</span> <span class="sentence">The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure.</span> <span class="sentence">On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1835, Johnson made a bid for election to the "floater" seat which <a class="link" href="./Greene_County,_Tennessee">Greene County</a> shared with neighboring <a class="link" href="./Washington_County,_Tennessee">Washington County</a> in the <a class="link" href="./Tennessee_House_of_Representatives">Tennessee House of Representatives</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">According to his biographer, <a class="link" href="./Hans_L._Trefousse">Hans L.

Dolly had three children over the years.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly, and the fact that Dolly was dark-skinned, and her offspring much lighter, led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father.</span> <span class="sentence">During his Greeneville days, Johnson joined the <a class="link" href="./Tennessee_Army_National_Guard">Tennessee Militia</a> as a member of the 90th Regiment.</span> <span class="sentence">He attained the rank of <a class="link" href="./Colonel_(United_States)">colonel</a>, though while an enrolled member, Johnson was fined for an unknown offense.</span> <span class="sentence">Afterwards, he was often addressed or referred to by his rank.</span> <span class="sentence">In his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the <a class="link" href="./Democratic_Party_(United_States)">Democratic</a> or the newly formed <a class="link" href="./Whig_Party_(United_States)">Whig Party</a>, though he revered President <a class="link" href="./Andrew_Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, a Democrat and fellow Tennessean.</span> <span class="sentence">The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system in a state of flux.</span> <span class="sentence">The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation.</span> <span class="sentence">After <a class="link" href="./Brookins_Campbell">Brookins Campbell</a> and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected.</span> <span class="sentence">From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity.</span> <span class="sentence">Although Democratic President <a class="link" href="./Martin_Van_Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> was defeated by former Ohio senator <a class="link" href="./William_Henry_Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column.</span> <span class="sentence">He was elected to the <a class="link" href="./Tennessee_Senate">Tennessee Senate</a> in 1841, where he served a two-year term.</span> <span class="sentence">He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics.</span> <span class="sentence">He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Having served in both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career.</span> <span class="sentence">He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated <a class="link" href="./Jonesborough,_Tennessee">Jonesborough</a> lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892.</span> <span class="sentence">In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-<a class="link" href="./Abolitionism_in_the_United_States">abolitionist</a> stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs.</span> <span class="sentence">With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the <a class="link" href="./Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, <a class="link" href="./James_K._Polk">James K. Polk</a>, <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1844">was elected president</a> in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson believed, as did many Southern Democrats, that the Constitution protected private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery.</span> <span class="sentence">He won a second term in 1845 against <a class="link" href="./William_Gannaway_Brownlow">Wiliam G. Brownlow</a>, presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy.</span> <span class="sentence">In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the <a class="link" href="./Mexican–American_War">Mexican War</a>, seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the <a class="link" href="./Wilmot_Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>, a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico.</span> <span class="sentence">He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant 160 acre to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it. This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.</span> <span class="sentence">In the <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1848">presidential election of 1848</a>, the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the <a class="link" href="./Free_Soil_Party">Free Soil Party</a>, with former president Van Buren as their nominee.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator <a class="link" href="./Lewis_Cass">Lewis Cass</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">With the party split, Whig nominee General <a class="link" href="./Zachary_Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson, due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district, also supported government assistance for the <a class="link" href="./East_Tennessee,_Virginia_and_Georgia_Railway">East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In his campaign for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections.</span> <span class="sentence">He defeated his opponent, <a class="link" href="./Nathaniel_G._Taylor">Nathaniel G. Taylor</a>, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns.</span> <span class="sentence">When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat <a class="link" href="./Howell_Cobb">Howell Cobb</a> was elected.</span> <span class="sentence">Once the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage.</span> <span class="sentence">Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union.</span> <span class="sentence">Kentucky's <a class="link" href="./Henry_Clay">Henry Clay</a> introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the <a class="link" href="./Compromise_of_1850">Compromise of 1850</a>, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation's capital.</span> <span class="sentence">He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the <a class="link" href="./Electoral_College_(United_States)">Electoral College</a>), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years.</span> <span class="sentence">These were all defeated.</span> <span class="sentence">A group of Democrats nominated <a class="link" href="./Landon_Carter_Haynes">Landon Carter Haynes</a> to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own.</span> <span class="sentence">The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes.</span> <span class="sentence">Though he was not enamored of the party's presidential nominee in 1852, former New Hampshire senator <a class="link" href="./Franklin_Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, Johnson campaigned for him.</span> <span class="sentence">Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate.</span> <span class="sentence">The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of <a class="link" href="./Gustavus_Adolphus_Henry,_Sr.">Gustavus Henry</a>, redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party.</span> <span class="sentence">The <i>Nashville Union</i> termed this "Henry-mandering"; lamented Johnson, "I have no political future."</span>

    <span class="sentence">The victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator.</span> <span class="sentence">Former Whig governor <a class="link" href="./William_B._Campbell">William B.

Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but <i>the people would send you</i>."</span> <span class="sentence">The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, <a class="link" href="./James_C._Jones">James C.

Dickinson</a>, a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy.</span> <span class="sentence">To sound a theme of unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the <a class="link" href="./National_Union_Party_(United_States)">National Union Party</a>, rather than the Republicans.</span> <span class="sentence">At <a class="link" href="./1864_National_Union_National_Convention">the party's convention</a> in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals.</span> <span class="sentence">After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War <a class="link" href="./Simon_Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M.

    <span class="sentence">Congress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Trefousse, "If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress".</span> <span class="sentence">The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868.</span> <span class="sentence">He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum.</span> <span class="sentence">A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.Illinois Senator <a class="link" href="./Lyman_Trumbull">Lyman Trumbull</a>, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President.</span> <span class="sentence">He ushered through Congress a bill extending the <a class="link" href="./Freedmen's_Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a> beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen.</span> <span class="sentence">Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord).</span> <span class="sentence">In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty.</span> <span class="sentence">Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators.</span> <span class="sentence">He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.</span> <span class="sentence">On February 22, 1866, <a class="link" href="./Washington's_Birthday">Washington's Birthday</a>, Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the <a class="link" href="./White_House">White House</a> and called for an address in honor of <a class="link" href="./George_Washington">the first president</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times.</span> <span class="sentence">More damagingly, he also spoke of "men ... still opposed to the Union" to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South.</span> <span class="sentence">When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman <a class="link" href="./Thaddeus_Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, Massachusetts Senator <a class="link" href="./Charles_Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, and abolitionist <a class="link" href="./Wendell_Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a>, and accused them of plotting his assassination.</span> <span class="sentence">Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.</span> <span class="sentence">Although strongly urged by Moderates to sign the <a class="link" href="./Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866">Civil Rights Bill</a>, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites.</span> <span class="sentence">Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history.</span> <span class="sentence">The veto of the <a class="link" href="./Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Eric_Foner">Eric Foner</a> in his volume on Reconstruction views it as "the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career".</span> <span class="sentence">According to Stewart, the veto was "for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency".</span> <span class="sentence">Congress also proposed the <a class="link" href="./Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the states.</span> <span class="sentence">Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further.</span> <span class="sentence">The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts.</span> <span class="sentence">It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts.</span> <span class="sentence">Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president.</span> <span class="sentence">Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden.</span> <span class="sentence">By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble.</span> <span class="sentence">His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition.</span> <span class="sentence">When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.</span> <span class="sentence">Efforts to compromise failed, and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party, North and South.</span> <span class="sentence">He called a convention of the National Union Party.</span> <span class="sentence">Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term, in 1868.</span> <span class="sentence">The battleground was the <a class="link" href="./United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1866">election of 1866</a>; Southern states were not allowed to vote.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the "<a class="link" href="./Swing_Around_the_Circle">Swing Around the Circle</a>".</span> <span class="sentence">The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers.</span> <span class="sentence">These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Secretary of War <a class="link" href="./Edwin_Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a> was an able and hard-working man, but difficult to deal with.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with <a class="link" href="./General_of_the_Army_(United_States)">General of the Army</a> Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary.</span> <span class="sentence">Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.</span> <span class="sentence">The new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached.</span> <span class="sentence">This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify.</span> <span class="sentence">When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution.</span> <span class="sentence">It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried.</span> <span class="sentence">A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.</span> <span class="sentence">Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities.</span> <span class="sentence">The President had Attorney General <a class="link" href="./Henry_Stanbery">Henry Stanbery</a> issue an opinion backing his position that they could not.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet.</span> <span class="sentence">Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications.</span> <span class="sentence">When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overruled it, and went home.</span> <span class="sentence">In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South.</span> <span class="sentence">With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General <a class="link" href="./Philip_Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.</span> <span class="sentence">Grant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, <a class="link" href="./Daniel_Sickles">Daniel Sickles</a>, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan.</span> <span class="sentence">The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths.</span> <span class="sentence">Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic.</span> <span class="sentence">No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the <a class="link" href="./Ohio_General_Assembly">Ohio General Assembly</a>, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator <a class="link" href="./Benjamin_Wade">Benjamin Wade</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.</span> <span class="sentence">The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson.</span> <span class="sentence">After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment.</span> <span class="sentence">In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act.</span> <span class="sentence">Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed <a class="link" href="./Lorenzo_Thomas">Lorenzo Thomas</a> to replace him.</span> <span class="sentence">Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.</span> <span class="sentence">On March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen <a class="link" href="./George_S._Boutwell">George S. Boutwell</a>, Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, and <a class="link" href="./William_M._Evarts">William M. Evarts</a>, <a class="link" href="./Benjamin_R._Curtis">Benjamin R. Curtis</a> and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge.</span> <span class="sentence">The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration.</span> <span class="sentence">Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator <a class="link" href="./James_W._Grimes">James W. Grimes</a> that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts.</span> <span class="sentence">Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson also promised to install the respected <a class="link" href="./John_Schofield">John Schofield</a> as War Secretary.</span> <span class="sentence">Kansas Senator <a class="link" href="./Edmund_G._Ross">Edmund G. Ross</a> received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal.</span> <span class="sentence">One reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate.</span> <span class="sentence">Wade, a <a class="link" href="./Lame_duck_(politics)">lame duck</a> who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation.</span> <span class="sentence">Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.</span> <span class="sentence">With the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension.</span> <span class="sentence">Thirty-five senators voted "guilty" and 19 "not guilty", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution.</span> <span class="sentence">Seven Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, <a class="link" href="./William_Pitt_Fessenden">William Pitt Fessenden</a>, <a class="link" href="./Joseph_S._Fowler">Joseph S. Fowler</a>, <a class="link" href="./John_B._Henderson">John B. Henderson</a>, and <a class="link" href="./Peter_G._Van_Winkle">Peter G. Van Winkle</a>—voted to acquit the President.</span> <span class="sentence">With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the <a class="link" href="./1868_Republican_National_Convention">Republican National Convention</a>; Grant was nominated for president.</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35–19 results.</span> <span class="sentence">Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings.</span> <span class="sentence">Stanton "relinquished" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield.</span> <span class="sentence">When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.</span> <span class="sentence">Allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial.</span> <span class="sentence">Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held contentious hearings, and issued a report, unendorsed by any other congressman.</span> <span class="sentence">Butler focused on a New York–based "Astor House Group", supposedly led by <a class="link" href="./Political_boss">political boss</a> and editor <a class="link" href="./Thurlow_Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson.</span> <span class="sentence">Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.</span>

    <span class="sentence">After leaving the presidency, Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington, then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years.</span> <span class="sentence">He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners.</span> <span class="sentence">He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Some expected Johnson to run for Governor of Tennessee or for the Senate again, while others that he would become a railroad executive.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson found Greeneville boring, and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869.</span> <span class="sentence">Seeking vindication for himself, and revenge against his political enemies, he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home.</span> <span class="sentence">Tennessee had gone Republican, but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the <a class="link" href="./Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> kept down the African-American vote, leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election, although hated by Radical Republicans, and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities.</span> <span class="sentence">Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting, the Republicans eventually elected <a class="link" href="./Henry_Cooper_(U.S._Senator)">Henry Cooper</a> over Johnson, 54–51.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1872, there was a special election for an [[Tennessee's at-large congressional district#1873 – 1875: One at-large seat, among nine other districts|at-large congressional seat for Tennessee]]; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination, but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general <a class="link" href="./Benjamin_F._Cheatham">Benjamin F. Cheatham</a>, decided to run as an independent.</span> <span class="sentence">The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally, <a class="link" href="./Horace_Maynard">Horace Maynard</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1873, Johnson contracted <a class="link" href="./Cholera">cholera</a> during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000, when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum.</span> <span class="sentence">He began looking towards the next Senate election, to take place in the legislature in early 1875.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson began to woo the farmers' <a class="link" href="./The_National_Grange_of_the_Order_of_Patrons_of_Husbandry">Grange movement</a>; with his <a class="link" href="./Jeffersonian_democracy">Jeffersonian leanings</a>, he easily gained their support.</span> <span class="sentence">He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour.</span> <span class="sentence">Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century.</span> <span class="sentence">In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session.</span> <span class="sentence">When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote.</span> <span class="sentence">Nashville erupted in rejoicing; remarked Johnson, "Thank God for the vindication."</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's comeback garnered national attention, with the ''St.</span> <span class="sentence">Louis Republican'' calling it, "the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show".</span> <span class="sentence">At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president, Hamlin, by that office's current incumbent, <a class="link" href="./Henry_Wilson">Henry Wilson</a>, who as senator had voted for his ousting.</span> <span class="sentence">Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's <a class="link" href="./John_Sherman">John Sherman</a> (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate.</span> <span class="sentence">He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government.</span> <span class="sentence">The former president asked, "How far off is military despotism?"</span> <span class="sentence">and concluded his speech, "may God bless this people and God save the Constitution."</span>

    <span class="sentence">Johnson returned home after the special session concluded.</span> <span class="sentence">In late July, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches.</span> <span class="sentence">He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near <a class="link" href="./Elizabethton,_Tennessee">Elizabethton</a>, where his daughter Martha was also staying.</span> <span class="sentence">That evening he suffered a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton.</span> <span class="sentence">He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the "painful duty" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president.</span> <span class="sentence">Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president.</span> <span class="sentence">Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville.</span> <span class="sentence">He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes.</span> <span class="sentence">The burial ground was dedicated as the <a class="link" href="./Andrew_Johnson_National_Cemetery">Andrew Johnson National Cemetery</a> in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the <a class="link" href="./Andrew_Johnson_National_Historic_Site">Andrew Johnson National Historic Site</a>.</span>

    <span class="sentence">According to Castel, "historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]".</span> <span class="sentence">Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator <a class="link" href="./James_G._Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>, depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress.</span> <span class="sentence">According to historian <a class="link" href="./Howard_K._Beale">Howard K. Beale</a> in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, "Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [Alabama congressman and historian] <a class="link" href="./Hilary_Herbert">Hilary Herbert</a> and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North."</span> <span class="sentence">The turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson.</span> <span class="sentence">Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian <a class="link" href="./James_Ford_Rhodes">James Ford Rhodes</a>, who wrote of the former president:</span> <span class="sentence">Rhodes ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South.</span> <span class="sentence">Other early 20th-century historians, such as <a class="link" href="./John_Burgess_(political_scientist)">John Burgess</a>, <a class="link" href="./Woodrow_Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> (who later became president himself) and <a class="link" href="./William_Dunning">William Dunning</a>, all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith.</span> <span class="sentence">Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson "depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain".</span> <span class="sentence">Even as Rhodes and his school wrote, <a class="link" href="./Dunning_School">another group of historians</a> was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary, <a class="link" href="./Gideon_Welles">Gideon Welles</a>, first published in 1911.</span> <span class="sentence">The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's <i>The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson</i> (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him.</span> <span class="sentence">In James Schouler's 1913 <i>History of the Reconstruction Period</i>, the author accused Rhodes of being "quite unfair to Johnson", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves.</span> <span class="sentence">These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.</span> <span class="sentence">Castel writes:</span> <span class="sentence">Beale wondered in 1940, "is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?"</span> <span class="sentence">Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1942, <a class="link" href="./Van_Heflin">Van Heflin</a> portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film <a class="link" href="./Tennessee_Johnson"><i>Tennessee Johnson</i></a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian <a class="link" href="./Arthur_M._Schlesinger">Arthur M. Schlesinger</a> deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great Chief Executives.</span> <span class="sentence">Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, "the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote".</span> <span class="sentence">Earlier historians, including Beale, believed that money drove events, and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle.</span> <span class="sentence">They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction.</span> <span class="sentence">In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction.</span> <span class="sentence">They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing <a class="link" href="./Civil_rights_movement">civil rights movement</a> as a second Reconstruction; <a class="link" href="./Neoabolitionism">some writers stated</a> they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights.</span> <span class="sentence">These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman.</span> <span class="sentence">In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as <a class="link" href="./Fawn_Brodie">Fawn Brodie</a>, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot.</span> <span class="sentence">These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton.</span> <span class="sentence">Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.</span> <span class="sentence">In the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history.</span> <span class="sentence">According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes <a class="link" href="./James_Buchanan">Buchanan</a> the worst president, "Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment ... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy ... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance."</span> <span class="sentence">Tolson suggests that "Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans".</span> <span class="sentence">Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, "there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice."</span> <span class="sentence">Trefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be "the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come."</span> <span class="sentence">Gordon-Reed states of Johnson:</span>
