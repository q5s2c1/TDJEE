It was originally intended for President Eisenhower to have a more active role in the campaign as he wanted to respond to attacks Kennedy made on his administration.</span> <span class="sentence">However, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower expressed concern to Second Lady Pat Nixon about the strain campaigning would put on his heart and wanted the President to back out of it without letting him know of her intervention.</span> <span class="sentence">Vice President Nixon himself also received concern from White House physician Major General Howard Snyder, who informed him that he could not approve a heavy campaign schedule for the President and his health had been exacerbated by Kennedy's attacks.</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon then convinced Eisenhower not to go ahead with the expanded campaign schedule and limit himself to the original schedule.</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon reflected that if Eisenhower had carried out his expanded campaign schedule he might have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the election, especially in states that Kennedy won with razor-thin margins.</span> <span class="sentence">It was years later before Mamie told Dwight why Nixon changed his mind on Dwight's campaigning.</span> <span class="sentence">On January 17, 1961, Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the <a class="link" href="./Oval_Office">Oval Office</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In his <a class="link" href="./Eisenhower's_farewell_address">farewell speech</a>, Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces.</span> <span class="sentence">He described the Cold War: "We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method ..."</span> <span class="sentence">and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that "we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the <a class="link" href="./Military–industrial_complex">military–industrial complex</a>."</span> <span class="sentence">He elaborated, "we recognize the imperative need for this development ... the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist ... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together."</span> <span class="sentence">Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, Eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission as <a class="link" href="./General_of_the_Army_(United_States)">General of the Army</a> before entering the office of President of the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">Upon completion of his Presidential term, his commission was reactivated by Congress and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five-star general in the United States Army.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Eisenhower's reputation declined in the immediate years after he left office.</span> <span class="sentence">During his presidency, he was widely seen by critics as an inactive, uninspiring, golf-playing president.</span> <span class="sentence">This was in stark contrast to his vigorous young successor, <a class="link" href="./John_F._Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, who was 26 years his junior.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at <a class="link" href="./Little_Rock_Central_High_School">Central High School</a> in Little Rock, Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the <a class="link" href="./Civil_rights">civil rights</a> movement to the degree that activists wanted.</span> <span class="sentence">Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the <a class="link" href="./1960_U-2_incident">1960 U-2 incident</a> and the associated international embarrassment, for the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in the <a class="link" href="./Nuclear_arms_race">nuclear arms race</a> and the <a class="link" href="./Space_Race">Space Race</a>, and for his failure to publicly oppose <a class="link" href="./McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In particular, Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend <a class="link" href="./George_Marshall">George Marshall</a> from attacks by <a class="link" href="./Joseph_McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, though he privately deplored McCarthy's tactics and claims.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./John_Lewis_Gaddis">John Lewis Gaddis</a> has summarized a more recent turnaround in evaluations by historians:</span> <span class="sentence">Historians long ago abandoned the view that Eisenhower's was a failed presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">He did, after all, end the Korean War without getting into any others.</span> <span class="sentence">He stabilized, and did not escalate, the Soviet–American rivalry.</span> <span class="sentence">He strengthened European alliances while withdrawing support from European colonialism.</span> <span class="sentence">He rescued the Republican Party from isolationism and McCarthyism.</span> <span class="sentence">He maintained prosperity, balanced the budget, promoted technological innovation, facilitated (if reluctantly) the civil rights movement and warned, in the most memorable farewell address since Washington's, of a "military–industrial complex" that could endanger the nation's liberties.</span> <span class="sentence">Not until Reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do. Although conservatism in politics was strong during the 1950s and Eisenhower generally espoused conservative sentiments, his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs (an area in which the career-military president had more knowledge) and pursued a hands-off domestic policy.</span> <span class="sentence">Eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance.</span> <span class="sentence">Although he sought to slow or contain the <a class="link" href="./New_Deal">New Deal</a> and other federal programs, he did not attempt to repeal them outright, and in doing so was popular among the liberal wing of the Republican Party.</span> <span class="sentence">Conservative critics of his administration found that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right; according to <a class="link" href="./Hans_Morgenthau">Hans Morgenthau</a>, "Eisenhower's victories were but accidents without consequence in the history of the Republican party."</span> <span class="sentence">Since the 19th century, many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or "gatekeeper", sometimes described as the president's private secretary, sometimes with no official title at all.</span> <span class="sentence">Eisenhower formalized this role, introducing the office of <a class="link" href="./White_House_Chief_of_Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> – an idea he borrowed from the United States Army.</span> <span class="sentence">Every president after <a class="link" href="./Lyndon_Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> has also appointed staff to this position.</span> <span class="sentence">Initially, <a class="link" href="./Gerald_Ford">Gerald Ford</a> and <a class="link" href="./Jimmy_Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> tried to operate without a chief of staff, but each eventually appointed one.</span> <span class="sentence">As president, Eisenhower also initiated the "<a class="link" href="./Up_or_out">up or out</a>" policy that still prevails in the U.S. military, whereby officers who are passed over for promotion twice are usually honorably but quickly discharged to make way for younger, more able officers.</span> <span class="sentence">(As an army officer, Eisenhower had been stuck at the rank of major for 16 years between the two world wars.)</span> <span class="sentence">On December 20, 1944, Eisenhower was appointed to the rank of General of the Army, placing him in the company of <a class="link" href="./George_Marshall">George Marshall</a>, <a class="link" href="./Henry_H._Arnold">Henry "Hap" Arnold</a>, and <a class="link" href="./Douglas_MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, the only four men to achieve the rank in World War Two, and along with <a class="link" href="./Omar_Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>, one of only five men to achieve the rank since the August 5, 1888 death of <a class="link" href="./Philip_Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, and the only five men to hold the rank as a <a class="link" href="./Five-star_rank">Five-star general</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The rank was created by an <a class="link" href="./Act_of_Congress">Act of Congress</a> on a temporary basis when <a class="link" href="./Act_of_Congress">Public Law</a> was passed on December 14, 1944, as a temporary rank, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war.</span> <span class="sentence">The temporary rank was then declared permanent March 23, 1946 by Public Law 333 of the <a class="link" href="./79th_Congress">79th Congress</a>, which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list.</span> <span class="sentence">It was created to give the most senior American commanders parity of rank with their British counterparts holding the ranks of <a class="link" href="./Field_marshal_(United_Kingdom)">field marshal</a> and <a class="link" href="./Admiral_of_the_fleet_(Royal_Navy)">admiral of the fleet</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">This second General of the Army rank is not the same as the post-Civil War era version because of its purpose and five stars.</span> <span class="sentence">Eisenhower founded <a class="link" href="./People_to_People_International">People to People International</a> in 1956, based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace.</span> <span class="sentence">The program includes a <a class="link" href="./People_to_People_Student_Ambassadors">student ambassador component</a>, which sends American youth on educational trips to other countries.</span> <span class="sentence">During his second term as president, Eisenhower distinctively preserved his presidential gratitude by awarding individuals a special memento.</span> <span class="sentence">This memento was a series of specially designed U.S. Mint presidential appreciation medals.</span> <span class="sentence">Eisenhower presented the medal as an expression of his appreciation and the medal is a keepsake reminder for the recipient.</span> <span class="sentence">The development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the Bureau of the Mint through the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.</span> <span class="sentence">The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960.</span> <span class="sentence">A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858.</span> <span class="sentence">Each of the designs incorporates the text "with appreciation" or "with personal and official gratitude" accompanied with Eisenhower's initials "D.D.E."</span> <span class="sentence">or facsimile signature.</span> <span class="sentence">The design also incorporates location, date, and/or significant event.</span> <span class="sentence">Prior to the end of his second term as President, 1,451 medals were turned in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed.</span> <span class="sentence">The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series.</span>
