A sign featuring a wooden pig was hung over the drugstore to tell the public about this unusual service. Farmers got the message, and it was Humphrey's that became known as the farmer's drugstore."</span> <span class="sentence">One biographer noted, "while Hubert Jr. minded the store and stirred the concoctions in the basement, Hubert Sr. went on the road selling 'Humphrey's BTV' (Body Tone Veterinary), a mineral supplement and dewormer for hogs, and 'Humphrey's Chest Oil' and 'Humphrey's Sniffles' for two-legged sufferers."</span> <span class="sentence">Humphrey later wrote, "we made 'Humphrey's Sniffles', a substitute for Vick's Nose Drops. I felt ours were better. Vick's used mineral oil, which is not absorbent, and we used a vegetable-oil base, which was. I added <a class="link" href="./Benzocaine">benzocaine</a>, a local anesthetic, so that even if the sniffles didn't get better, you felt it less."</span> <span class="sentence">The various "Humphrey cures...worked well enough and constituted an important part of the family income...the farmers that bought the medicines were good customers."</span> <span class="sentence">Over time Humphrey's Drug Store became a profitable enterprise and the family again prospered.</span> <span class="sentence">While living in Huron, Humphrey regularly attended Huron's largest Methodist church and became the scoutmaster of the church's Boy Scout group, Troop 6.</span> <span class="sentence">He "started basketball games in the church basement...although his scouts had no money for camp in 1931, Hubert found a way in the worst of that summer's dust-storm grit, grasshoppers, and depression to lead an overnight [outing]."</span> <span class="sentence">Humphrey did not enjoy working as a pharmacist, and his dream remained to earn a doctorate in political science and become a college professor.</span> <span class="sentence">His unhappiness was manifested in "stomach pains and fainting spells", though doctors could find nothing wrong with him.</span> <span class="sentence">In August 1937, he told his father that he wanted to return to the University of Minnesota.</span> <span class="sentence">Hubert Sr. tried to convince his son not to leave by offering him a full partnership in the store, but Hubert Jr. refused and told his father "how depressed I was, almost physically ill from the work, the <a class="link" href="./Dust_bowl">dust storms</a>, the conflict between my desire to do something and be somebody and my loyalty to him...he replied "Hubert, if you aren't happy, then you ought to do something about it."
