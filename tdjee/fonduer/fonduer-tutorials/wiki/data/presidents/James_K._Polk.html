    <span class="sentence">By the time the legislature adjourned its session in September 1822, Polk was determined to be a candidate for the <a class="link" href="./Tennessee_House_of_Representatives">Tennessee House of Representatives</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The election was in August 1823, almost a year away, allowing him ample time for campaigning.</span> <span class="sentence">Already involved locally as a member of the <a class="link" href="./Freemasonry">Masons</a>, he was commissioned in the Tennessee militia as a captain in the cavalry regiment of the 5th Brigade.</span> <span class="sentence">He was later appointed a colonel on the staff of Governor <a class="link" href="./William_Carroll_(Tennessee_politician)">William Carroll</a>, and was afterwards often referred to as "Colonel".</span> <span class="sentence">Although many of the voters were members of the Polk clan, the young politician campaigned energetically.</span> <span class="sentence">People liked Polk's oratory, which earned him the nickname "Napoleon of the Stump."</span> <span class="sentence">At the polls, where Polk provided alcoholic refreshments for his voters, he defeated incumbent William Yancey.</span> <span class="sentence">Beginning in early 1822, Polk courted <a class="link" href="./Sarah_Childress">Sarah Childress</a>—they were engaged the following year and married on January 1, 1824 in Murfreesboro.</span> <span class="sentence">Educated far better than most women of her time, especially in frontier Tennessee, Sarah Polk was from one of the state's most prominent families.</span> <span class="sentence">During James's political career Sarah assisted her husband with his speeches, gave him advice on policy matters, and played an active role in his campaigns.</span> <span class="sentence">Rawley noted that Sarah Polk's grace, intelligence and charming conversation helped compensate for her husband's often austere manner.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's first mentor was Grundy, but in the legislature, Polk came increasingly to oppose him on such matters as land reform, and came to support the policies of Andrew Jackson, by then a military hero for his victory at the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_New_Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a> (1815).</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson was a family friend to both the Polks and the Childresses—there is evidence Sarah Polk and her siblings called him "Uncle Andrew"—and James Polk quickly came to support his presidential ambitions for 1824.</span> <span class="sentence">When the <a class="link" href="./Tennessee_Legislature">Tennessee Legislature</a> deadlocked on who to elect as U.S. senator in 1823 (until 1913, legislators, not the people, elected senators), Jackson's name was placed in nomination.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk broke from his usual allies, casting his vote as a member of the state House of Representatives for the general in Jackson's victory.</span> <span class="sentence">This boosted Jackson's presidential chances by giving him recent political experience to match his military accomplishments.</span> <span class="sentence">This began an alliance that would continue until Jackson's death early in Polk's presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk, through much of his political career, was known as "Young Hickory", based on the nickname for Jackson, "Old Hickory".</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's political career was as dependent on Jackson as his nickname implied.</span> <span class="sentence">In the <a class="link" href="./1824_U.S._presidential_election">1824 U.S. presidential election</a>, Jackson got the most electoral votes (he also led in the popular vote) but as he did not receive a majority in the <a class="link" href="./Electoral_College_(United_States)">Electoral College</a>, the election was thrown into the <a class="link" href="./U.S._House_of_Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, which chose Secretary of State <a class="link" href="./John_Quincy_Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, who had received the second-most of each.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk, like other Jackson supporters, believed that Speaker of the House <a class="link" href="./Henry_Clay">Henry Clay</a> had traded his support as fourth-place finisher (the House may only choose from among the top three) to Adams in a <a class="link" href="./Corrupt_bargain#Election of 1824">Corrupt Bargain</a> in exchange for being the new Secretary of State.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk had in August 1824 declared his candidacy for the following year's election to the House of Representatives from <a class="link" href="./Tennessee's_6th_congressional_district">Tennessee's 6th congressional district</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The district stretched from Maury County south to the Alabama line, and extensive electioneering was expected of the five candidates.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah began to worry about his health.</span> <span class="sentence">During the campaign, Polk's opponents said that at the age of 29 Polk was too young for the responsibility of a seat in the House, but he won the election with 3,669 votes out of 10,440 and took his seat in Congress later that year.</span>

    <span class="sentence">In December 1833, after being elected to a fifth consecutive term, Polk, with Jackson's backing, became the chairman of Ways and Means, a powerful position in the House.</span> <span class="sentence">In that position, Polk supported Jackson's withdrawal of federal funds from the Second Bank.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's committee issued a report questioning the Second Bank's finances, and another supporting Jackson's actions against it. In April 1834, the Ways and Means Committee reported a bill to regulate state deposit banks, which, when passed, enabled Jackson to deposit funds in <a class="link" href="./Pet_banks">pet banks</a>, and Polk got legislation passed to allow the sale of the government's stock in the Second Bank.</span> <span class="sentence">In June 1834, <a class="link" href="./Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a class="link" href="./Andrew_Stevenson">Andrew Stevenson</a> resigned from Congress to become <a class="link" href="./United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom">Minister to the United Kingdom</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">With Jackson's support, Polk ran for Speaker against fellow Tennessean <a class="link" href="./John_Bell_(Tennessee_politician)">John Bell</a>, Calhoun disciple <a class="link" href="./Richard_Henry_Wilde">Richard Henry Wilde</a>, and <a class="link" href="./Joel_Barlow_Sutherland">Joel Barlow Sutherland</a> of Pennsylvania.</span> <span class="sentence">After ten ballots, Bell, who had the support of many opponents of the administration, defeated Polk.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson called in political debts to try to get Polk elected Speaker at the start of the next Congress in December 1835, assuring Polk in a letter he meant him to burn that New England would support him for Speaker.</span> <span class="sentence">They were successful; Polk defeated Bell to take the Speakership.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Thomas M.

    <span class="sentence">Rumors of Polk's nomination reached Nashville on June 4, much to Jackson's delight; they were substantiated later that day.</span> <span class="sentence">The dispatches were sent on to Columbia, arriving the same day, and letters and newspapers describing what had happened at Baltimore were in Polk's hands by June 6.</span> <span class="sentence">He accepted his nomination by letter dated June 12, alleging that he had never sought the office, and stating his intent to serve only one term.</span> <span class="sentence">Wright was embittered by what he called the "foul plot" against Van Buren, and demanded assurances that Polk had played no part; it was only after Polk professed that he had remained loyal to Van Buren that Wright supported his campaign.</span> <span class="sentence">Following the custom of the time that presidential candidates avoid electioneering or appearing to seek the office, Polk remained in Columbia and made no speeches.</span> <span class="sentence">He engaged in an extensive correspondence with Democratic Party officials as he managed his campaign.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk made his views known in his acceptance letter and through responses to questions sent by citizens that were printed in newspapers, often by arrangement.</span> <span class="sentence">A potential pitfall for Polk's campaign was the issue of whether the tariff should be for revenue only, or with the intent to protect American industry.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk finessed the tariff issue in a published letter.</span> <span class="sentence">Recalling that he had long stated that tariffs should only be sufficient to finance government operations, he maintained that stance, but wrote that within that limitation, government could and should offer "fair and just protection" to American interests, including manufacturers.</span> <span class="sentence">He refused to expand on this stance, acceptable to most Democrats, despite the Whigs pointing out that he had committed himself to nothing.</span> <span class="sentence">In September, a delegation of Whigs from nearby <a class="link" href="./Giles_County,_Tennessee">Giles County</a> came to Columbia, armed with specific questions on Polk's views regarding the current tariff, the Whig-passed <a class="link" href="./Tariff_of_1842">Tariff of 1842</a>, and with the stated intent of remaining in Columbia until they got answers.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk took several days to respond, and chose to stand by his earlier statement, provoking an outcry in the Whig papers.</span> <span class="sentence">Another concern was the third-party candidacy of President Tyler, which might split the Democratic vote.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler had been nominated by a group of loyal officeholders.</span> <span class="sentence">Under no illusions he could win, he believed he could rally states' rights supporters and populists to hold the balance of power in the election.</span> <span class="sentence">Only Jackson had the stature to resolve the situation, which he did with two letters to friends in the Cabinet, that he knew would be shown to Tyler, stating that the President's supporters would be welcomed back into the Democratic fold.</span> <span class="sentence">Jackson wrote that once Tyler withdrew, many Democrats would embrace him for his pro-annexation stance.</span> <span class="sentence">The former president also used his influence to stop <a class="link" href="./Francis_Preston_Blair">Francis Blair</a> and his <i>Globe</i> newspaper, the semi-official organ of the Democratic Party, from attacking Tyler.</span> <span class="sentence">These proved enough; Tyler withdrew from the race in August.</span> <span class="sentence">Party troubles were a third concern.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk and Calhoun made peace when a former South Carolina congressman, <a class="link" href="./Francis_Pickens">Francis Pickens</a> visited Tennessee and came to Columbia for two days and to the Hermitage for sessions with the increasingly ill Jackson.</span> <span class="sentence">Calhoun wanted the <i>Globe</i> dissolved, and that Polk would act against the 1842 tariff and promote Texas annexation.</span> <span class="sentence">Reassured on these points, Calhoun became a strong supporter.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk was aided regarding Texas when Clay, realizing his anti-annexation letter had cost him support, attempted in two subsequent letters to clarify his position.</span> <span class="sentence">These angered both sides, which attacked Clay as insincere.</span> <span class="sentence">Texas also threatened to divide the Democrats sectionally, but Polk managed to appease most Southern party leaders without antagonizing Northern ones.</span> <span class="sentence">As the election drew closer, it became clear that most of the country favored the annexation of Texas, and some Southern Whig leaders supported Polk's campaign due to Clay's anti-annexation stance.</span> <span class="sentence">The campaign was vitriolic; both major party candidates were accused of various acts of malfeasance; Polk was accused of being both a duelist and a coward.</span> <span class="sentence">The most damaging smear was the <a class="link" href="./Black_propaganda#United States media">Roorback forgery</a>; in late August an item appeared in an <a class="link" href="./Abolitionist">abolitionist</a> newspaper, part of a book detailing fictional travels through the South of a Baron von Roorback, an imaginary German nobleman.</span> <span class="sentence">The Ithaca <i>Chronicle</i> printed it without labeling it as fiction, and inserted a sentence alleging that the traveler had seen forty slaves who had been sold by Polk after being branded with his initials.</span> <span class="sentence">The item was withdrawn by the <i>Chronicle</i> when challenged by the Democrats, but it was widely reprinted.</span> <span class="sentence">Borneman suggested that the forgery backfired on Polk's opponents as it served to remind voters that Clay too was a slaveholder, <a class="link" href="./John_Eisenhower">John Eisenhower</a>, in his journal article on the election, stated that the smear came too late to be effectively rebutted, and likely cost Polk Ohio.</span> <span class="sentence">Southern newspapers, on the other hand, went far in defending Polk, one Nashville newspaper alleging that his slaves preferred their bondage to freedom.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk himself implied to newspaper correspondents that the only slaves he owned had either been inherited or had been purchased from relatives in financial distress; this paternalistic image was also painted by surrogates like Gideon Pillow.</span> <span class="sentence">This was not true, though not known at the time; by then he had bought over thirty slaves, both from relatives and others, mainly for the purpose of procuring labor for his Mississippi cotton plantation.</span> <span class="sentence">There was no uniform election day in 1844; states voted between November 1 and 12. Polk won the election with 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes.</span> <span class="sentence">Becoming the first president elected despite losing his state of residence (Tennessee), Polk also lost his birth state, North Carolina.</span> <span class="sentence">However, he won Pennsylvania and New York, where Clay lost votes to the antislavery Liberty Party candidate <a class="link" href="./James_G._Birney">James G. Birney</a>, who got more votes in New York than Polk's margin of victory.</span> <span class="sentence">Had Clay won New York, he would have been elected president.</span>

    <span class="sentence">After being informed of his victory on November 15, 1844, Polk turned his attention to forming a geographically-balanced Cabinet.</span> <span class="sentence">He consulted Jackson and one or two other close allies, and decided that the large states of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia should have representation in the six-member Cabinet, as should his home state of Tennessee.</span> <span class="sentence">At a time when an incoming president might retain some or all of his predecessor's department heads, Polk wanted an entirely fresh Cabinet, but this proved delicate.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler's final Secretary of State was Calhoun, leader of a considerable faction of the Democratic Party, but, when approached by emissaries, he did not take offense and was willing to step down.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk did not want his Cabinet to contain presidential hopefuls, though he chose to nominate <a class="link" href="./James_Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> of Pennsylvania, whose ambition for the presidency was well-known, as Secretary of State.</span> <span class="sentence">Tennessee's <a class="link" href="./Cave_Johnson">Cave Johnson</a>, a close friend and ally of Polk, was nominated for the position of Postmaster General, with George Bancroft, the historian who had placed a crucial role in Polk's nomination as Navy Secretary.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's choices met with the approval of Andrew Jackson, whom Polk met with in January 1845 for the last time, as Jackson died that June.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler's last Navy Secretary, <a class="link" href="./John_Y._Mason">John Y. Mason</a> of Virginia, Polk's friend since college days and a longtime political ally, was not on the original list.</span> <span class="sentence">As Cabinet choices were affected by factional politics and President Tyler's drive to resolve the Texas issue before leaving office, Polk at the last minute chose him as Attorney General.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk also chose Mississippi Senator Walker as Secretary of the Treasury and New York's <a class="link" href="./William_Marcy">William Marcy</a> as Secretary of War.</span> <span class="sentence">All gained Senate confirmation after Polk took office.</span> <span class="sentence">The members worked well together, and few replacements were necessary.</span> <span class="sentence">One reshuffle was required in 1846 when Bancroft, who wanted a diplomatic posting, became <a class="link" href="./United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom">U.S. minister to Britain</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">As Polk put together his Cabinet, President Tyler sought to complete the annexation of Texas.</span> <span class="sentence">While the Senate had defeated an earlier treaty that would annex the republic, Tyler urged Congress to pass a joint resolution, relying on its constitutional power to admit states.</span> <span class="sentence">There were disagreements about the terms under which Texas would be admitted and Polk became involved in negotiations to break the impasse.</span> <span class="sentence">With Polk's help, the annexation resolution narrowly cleared the Senate.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler was unsure whether to sign the resolution or leave it for Polk, and sent Calhoun to consult with the <a class="link" href="./President-elect_of_the_United_States">President-elect</a>, who declined to give any advice.</span> <span class="sentence">On his final evening in office, March 3, 1845, Tyler offered annexation to Texas according to the terms of the resolution.</span> <span class="sentence">Even before his inauguration, Polk wrote to Cave Johnson, "I intend to be President of the U.S."</span> <span class="sentence">He would gain a reputation as a hard worker, spending ten to twelve hours at his desk, and rarely leaving Washington.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk wrote, "No President who performs his duty faithfully and conscientiously can have any leisure. I prefer to supervise the whole operations of the government myself rather than intrust the public business to subordinates, and this makes my duties very great."</span> <span class="sentence">When he took office on March 4, 1845, Polk, at 49, became the <a class="link" href="./List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age">youngest president</a> to that point.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's inauguration was the first <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_inauguration">inaugural ceremony</a> to be reported by telegraph, and first to be shown in a newspaper illustration (in <a class="link" href="./The_Illustrated_London_News"><i>The Illustrated London News</i></a>).</span> <span class="sentence">In his inaugural address, delivered in a steady rain, Polk made clear his support for annexation by referring to the 28 states, thus including Texas.</span> <span class="sentence">He proclaimed his fidelity to Jackson's principles by quoting his famous toast, "Every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment, 'Our Federal Union—it must be preserved.'" He stated his opposition to a national bank, and repeated that the tariff could include incidental protection.</span> <span class="sentence">Although he did not mention slavery specifically, he alluded to it, decrying those who would tear down an institution protected by the Constitution.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk devoted the second half of his speech to foreign affairs, and specifically to expansion.</span> <span class="sentence">He applauded the annexation of Texas, warning that Texas was no affair of any other nation, and certainly none of Mexico's.</span> <span class="sentence">He spoke of the Oregon Country, and of the many who were migrating, pledging to safeguard America's rights there, and to protect the settlers.</span> <span class="sentence">As well as appointing Cabinet officers to advise him, Polk made his sister's son, <a class="link" href="./Joseph_Knox_Walker">J. Knox Walker</a>, his <a class="link" href="./Secretary_to_the_President_of_the_United_States">personal secretary</a>, an especially important position because, other than his slaves, Polk had no staff at the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">Walker, who lived at the White House with his growing family (two children were born to him while living there), performed his duties competently through his uncle's presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Other Polk relatives visited at the White House, some for extended periods.</span>

the Pacific Coast to the <a class="link" href="./42nd_parallel_north">42nd parallel</a>, ceded any claims it might have north of that to the United States under the <a class="link" href="./Adams–Onís_Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> of 1819.</span> <span class="sentence">Rather than war over the distant and low-population territory, the United States and Britain had negotiated.</span> <span class="sentence">Since the signing of the <a class="link" href="./Treaty_of_1818">Treaty of 1818</a>, the Oregon Country had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">Previous U.S. administrations had offered to divide the region along the <a class="link" href="./49th_parallel_north">49th parallel</a>, which was not acceptable to Britain, as it had commercial interests along the Columbia River.</span> <span class="sentence">Britain's preferred partition was unacceptable to Polk, as it would have awarded <a class="link" href="./Puget_Sound">Puget Sound</a> and all lands north of the Columbia River to Britain, and Britain was unwilling to accept the 49th parallel extended to the Pacific, as it meant the entire opening to Puget Sound would be in American hands, isolating its settlements along the <a class="link" href="./Fraser_River">Fraser River</a>.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Edward_Everett">Edward Everett</a>, President Tyler's ambassador to Great Britain, had informally proposed dividing the territory at the 49th parallel with the strategic <a class="link" href="./Vancouver_Island">Vancouver Island</a> granted to the British, thus allowing an opening to the Pacific, but when the new British minister in Washington, <a class="link" href="./Richard_Pakenham">Richard Pakenham</a> arrived in 1844 prepared to follow up, he found that many Americans desired the entire territory.</span> <span class="sentence">Oregon had not been a major issue in the 1844 election, but the heavy influx of settlers, mostly American, to the Oregon Country in 1845, and the rising spirit of expansionism in the United States as Texas and Oregon seized the public's eye, made a treaty with Britain more urgent.</span> <span class="sentence">Many Democrats believed that the United States should span from coast to coast, a philosophy described as <a class="link" href="./Manifest_Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Though both sides sought an acceptable compromise, each also saw the territory as an important geopolitical asset that would play a large part in determining the dominant power in North America.</span> <span class="sentence">In his inaugural address, Polk announced that he viewed the American claim to the land as "clear and unquestionable", provoking threats of war from British leaders should Polk attempt to take control of the entire territory.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk had refrained in his address from asserting a claim to the entire territory, which extended north to 54 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, although the Democratic Party platform called for such a claim.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite Polk's hawkish rhetoric, he viewed war with the British as unwise, and Polk and Buchanan opened up negotiations with the British.</span> <span class="sentence">Like his predecessors, Polk again proposed a division along the 49th parallel, which was immediately rejected by Pakenham.</span> <span class="sentence">Secretary of State Buchanan was wary of a two-front war with Mexico and Britain, but Polk was willing to risk war with both countries in pursuit of a favorable settlement.</span> <span class="sentence">In his annual message to Congress in December 1845, Polk requested approval of giving Britain a one-year notice (as required in the Treaty of 1818) of his intention to terminate the joint occupancy of Oregon.</span> <span class="sentence">In that message, he quoted from the <a class="link" href="./Monroe_Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> to denote America's intention of keeping European powers out, the first significant use of it since its origin in 1823.</span> <span class="sentence">After much debate, Congress eventually passed the resolution in April 1846, attaching its hope that the dispute would be settled amicably.</span> <span class="sentence">When the British Foreign Secretary, <a class="link" href="./George_Hamilton-Gordon,_4th_Earl_of_Aberdeen">Lord Aberdeen</a>, learned of the proposal rejected by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open negotiations, but Polk was unwilling unless a proposal was made by the British.</span> <span class="sentence">With Britain moving towards free trade with the <a class="link" href="./Repeal_of_the_Corn_Laws">repeal of the Corn Laws</a>, good trade relations with the United States were more important to Aberdeen than a distant territory.</span> <span class="sentence">In February 1846, Polk allowed Buchanan to inform <a class="link" href="./Louis_McLane">Louis McLane</a>, the American ambassador to Britain, that Polk's administration would look favorably on a British proposal based around a division at the 49th parallel.</span> <span class="sentence">In June 1846, Pakenham presented an offer to the Polk administration, calling for a boundary line at the 49th parallel, with the exception that Britain would retain all of Vancouver Island, and there would be limited navigation rights for British subjects on the Columbia River until the expiration of the charter of the <a class="link" href="./Hudson's_Bay_Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> in 1859.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk and most of his Cabinet were prepared to accept the proposal, but Buchanan, in a reversal, urged that the United States seek control of all of the Oregon Territory.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk deemed Buchanan's about-face linked to his presidential ambitions.</span> <span class="sentence">After winning the reluctant approval of Buchanan, and choosing to have the Senate weigh in (favorably) on the draft treaty, Polk submitted the full treaty to the Senate for ratification.</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate ratified the <a class="link" href="./Oregon_Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> in a 41–14 vote, with opposition from diehards who sought the full territory.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's willingness to risk war with Britain had frightened many, but his tough negotiation tactics may have gained the United States concessions from the British (particularly regarding the Columbia River) that a more conciliatory president might not have won.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Following the Texan ratification of annexation in 1845, both Mexicans and Americans saw conflict as a likely possibility.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk began preparations for a potential war with Mexico over Texas, sending an army led by Brigadier General <a class="link" href="./Zachary_Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> into Texas.</span> <span class="sentence">Taylor and Commodore <a class="link" href="./David_Conner_(naval_officer)">David Conner</a> of the U.S. Navy, commanding American ships off the Mexican coast, were both ordered to avoid provoking a war, while preparing for conflict, and to respond to any Mexican aggression.</span> <span class="sentence">Although Polk had the military prepare for war, he did not believe it would come to that; he thought Mexico would give in under duress.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk hoped that a show of force by the U.S. military under Taylor and Conner could avert war and lead to negotiations with the Mexican government.</span> <span class="sentence">In late 1845, Polk sent diplomat <a class="link" href="./John_Slidell">John Slidell</a> to Mexico to purchase New Mexico and California for $20–40 million, as well as securing Mexico's agreement to a Rio Grande border.</span> <span class="sentence">Slidell arrived in <a class="link" href="./Mexico_City">Mexico City</a> in December 1845.</span> <span class="sentence">Mexican President <a class="link" href="./José_Joaquín_de_Herrera">José Joaquín de Herrera</a> was unwilling to receive him because of the hostility of the public towards the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">Slidell's ambassadorial credentials were refused by a Mexican council of government, and Herrara soon thereafter was deposed by a military coup led by General <a class="link" href="./Mariano_Paredes_(President_of_Mexico)">Mariano Paredes</a>, a hard-liner who pledged to take back Texas from the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">Dispatches from Slidell and from the U.S. consul in Mexico City, <a class="link" href="./John_Black_(U.S._Senator)">John Black</a>, made clear their views that U.S. aims for territorial expansion could not be accomplished without war.</span> <span class="sentence">Taylor's instructions were to repel any incursion by Mexico north of the Rio Grande, but initially, his army did not advance further than <a class="link" href="./Corpus_Christi,_Texas">Corpus Christi</a>, at the mouth of the Nueces.</span> <span class="sentence">On January 13, 1846, Polk ordered Taylor to proceed to the Rio Grande, though it took him time to prepare for the march.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk was convinced that sending Taylor to the <a class="link" href="./Nueces_Strip">Nueces Strip</a> would prompt war; even if it did not, he was prepared to have Congress declare it. As he waited, Polk considered supporting a potential coup led by the exiled Mexican General <a class="link" href="./Antonio_López_de_Santa_Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> with the hope that Santa Anna would sell parts of California.</span> <span class="sentence">Slidell returned to Washington in May 1846 and gave his opinion that negotiations with the Mexican government were unlikely to be successful.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk regarded the treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an "ample cause of war", and he prepared to ask Congress for a declaration of war.</span> <span class="sentence">Meanwhile, in late March, General Taylor had reached the Rio Grande, and his army camped across the river from <a class="link" href="./Matamoros,_Tamaulipas">Matamoros, Tamaulipas</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In April, after Mexican general <a class="link" href="./Pedro_de_Ampudia">Pedro de Ampudia</a> demanded that Taylor return to the Nueces River, Taylor began a blockade of Matamoros.</span> <span class="sentence">A skirmish on the northern side of the Rio Grande on April 25 ended in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers, and became known as the <a class="link" href="./Thornton_Affair">Thornton Affair</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Word did not reach Washington until May 9, and Polk immediately convened the Cabinet and obtained their approval of his plan to send a war message to Congress on the ground that Mexico had, as Polk put it in his message, "shed American blood on the American soil".</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's message was crafted to present the war as a just and necessary defense of the country against a neighbor that had long troubled the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">The House overwhelmingly approved a resolution declaring war and authorizing the president to accept 50,000 volunteers into the military.</span> <span class="sentence">Some of those voting in favor were unconvinced that the U.S. had just cause to go to war, but feared to be deemed unpatriotic.</span> <span class="sentence">In the Senate, war opponents led by Calhoun also questioned Polk's version of events.</span> <span class="sentence">Nonetheless, the House resolution passed the Senate in a 40–2 vote, with Calhoun abstaining, marking the beginning of the Mexican–American War.</span>

    <span class="sentence">After the initial skirmishes, Taylor and much of his army marched away from the river to secure the supply line, leaving a makeshift base, <a class="link" href="./Fort_Texas">Fort Texas</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">On the way back to the Rio Grande, Mexican forces under General <a class="link" href="./Mariano_Arista">Mariano Arista</a> attempted to block Taylor's way as other troops <a class="link" href="./Siege_of_Fort_Texas">laid siege to Fort Texas</a>, forcing the American general to the attack if he hoped to relieve the fort.</span> <span class="sentence">In the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Palo_Alto">Battle of Palo Alto</a>, the first major engagement of the war, Taylor's troops forced Arista's from the field, suffering only four dead to hundreds for the Mexicans.</span> <span class="sentence">The next day, Taylor led the army to victory in the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Resaca_de_la_Palma">Battle of Resaca de la Palma</a>, putting the Mexican Army to rout.</span> <span class="sentence">The early successes boosted support for the war, which despite the lopsided votes in Congress had deeply divided the nation.</span> <span class="sentence">Many Northern Whigs opposed the war, as did others; they felt Polk had used patriotism to manipulate the nation into fighting a war the goal of which was to give slavery room to expand.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk distrusted the two senior officers, <a class="link" href="./Major_general_(United_States)">Major General</a> <a class="link" href="./Winfield_Scott">Winfield Scott</a> and Taylor, as both were Whigs, and would have replaced them with Democrats, but felt Congress would not approve it. He offered Scott the position of top commander in the war, which the general accepted.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk and Scott already knew and disliked each other: the President made the appointment despite the fact that Scott had sought his party's presidential nomination in 1840.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk came to believe that Scott was too slow in getting himself and his army away from Washington and to the Rio Grande, and was outraged to learn Scott was using his influence in Congress to defeat the administration's plan to expand the number of generals.</span> <span class="sentence">The news of Taylor's victory at Resaca de la Palma arrived then, and Polk decided to have Taylor take command in the field, and Scott to remain in Washington.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk also ordered Commodore Conner to allow Santa Anna to return to Mexico from his exile in Havana, and sent an army expedition led by <a class="link" href="./Stephen_W._Kearny">Stephen W. Kearny</a> towards Santa Fe. In 1845, Polk, fearful of French or British intervention, had sent Lieutenant <a class="link" href="./Archibald_H._Gillespie">Archibald H. Gillespie</a> to California with orders to foment a pro-American rebellion that could be used to justify annexation of the territory.</span> <span class="sentence">After meeting with Gillespie, Army captain <a class="link" href="./John_C._Frémont">John C. Frémont</a> led settlers in northern California to overthrow the Mexican garrison in <a class="link" href="./Sonoma,_California">Sonoma</a> in what became known as the <a class="link" href="./California_Republic">Bear Flag Revolt</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In August 1846, American forces under Kearny captured Santa Fe, capital of the province of <a class="link" href="./Santa_Fe_de_Nuevo_México">New Mexico</a>, without firing a shot.</span> <span class="sentence">Almost simultaneously, Commodore <a class="link" href="./Robert_F._Stockton">Robert F. Stockton</a> landed in <a class="link" href="./Los_Angeles,_California">Los Angeles</a> and proclaimed the capture of California.</span> <span class="sentence">After American forces put down a revolt, the United States held effective control of New Mexico and California.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, the Western theater of the war would prove to be a political headache for Polk, as a dispute between Frémont and Kearny led to a break between Polk and the powerful Missouri senator (and father-in-law of Frémont), <a class="link" href="./Thomas_Hart_Benton_(politician)">Thomas Hart Benton</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The initial public euphoria over the victories at the start of the war slowly dissipated.</span> <span class="sentence">In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million as a down payment for the potential purchase of Mexican lands.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's request ignited opposition, as he had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas).</span> <span class="sentence">It was unclear whether such newly acquired lands would be slave or free, and there was angry sectional debate.</span> <span class="sentence">A freshman Democratic Congressman, <a class="link" href="./David_Wilmot">David Wilmot</a> of Pennsylvania, previously a firm supporter of Polk's administration, offered an amendment to the bill—the "<a class="link" href="./Wilmot_Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>"—that would ban slavery in any land acquired using the money.</span> <span class="sentence">The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House, but died in the Senate.</span> <span class="sentence">This discord cost Polk's party, as Democrats lost control of the House in the <a class="link" href="./United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1846">1846 elections</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In early 1847, though, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the appropriation.</span> <span class="sentence">In July 1846, American envoy <a class="link" href="./Alexander_Slidell_Mackenzie">Alexander Slidell Mackenzie</a> had met with Santa Anna, offering terms by which the US would pay to acquire <a class="link" href="./San_Francisco_Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and other parts of Alta California.</span> <span class="sentence">Santa Anna seemed receptive, but after returning to Mexico, taking control of the government, he stated that he would fight against the Americans, and placed himself at the head of the army.</span> <span class="sentence">This caused Polk to harden his position on Mexico, and he ordered an American landing at <a class="link" href="./Veracruz_(city)">Veracruz</a>, the most important Mexican port on the <a class="link" href="./Gulf_of_Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">From there, troops were to march to Mexico City, which it was hoped would end the war.</span> <span class="sentence">Continuing to advance in northeast Mexico, Taylor defeated a Mexican army led by Ampudia in the September 1846 <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Monterrey">Battle of Monterrey</a>, but allowed Ampudia's forces to withdraw from the town, much to Polk's consternation.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk believed Taylor had not aggressively pursued the enemy, and reluctantly offered command of the Veracruz expedition to Scott.</span> <span class="sentence">The lack of trust Polk had in Taylor was returned by the Whig general, who feared the partisan president was trying to destroy him.</span> <span class="sentence">Accordingly, Taylor disobeyed orders to remain near Monterrey.</span> <span class="sentence">In March 1847, Polk learned that Taylor had continued to march south, capturing the northern Mexican town of <a class="link" href="./Saltillo">Saltillo</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Continuing beyond Saltillo, Taylor's army decimated a larger Mexican force, led by Santa Anna, in the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Buena_Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Mexican casualties were five times that of the Americans, and the victory made Taylor even more of a military hero in the public's eyes, though Polk preferred to credit the bravery of the soldiers rather than the Whig general.</span> <span class="sentence">In March 1847, Scott landed in Veracruz, and quickly <a class="link" href="./Siege_of_Veracruz">won control</a> of the city.</span> <span class="sentence">With the capture of Veracruz, Polk dispatched <a class="link" href="./Nicholas_Trist">Nicholas Trist</a>, Buchanan's chief clerk, to accompany Scott's army and negotiate a peace treaty with Mexican leaders.</span> <span class="sentence">Trist was instructed to seek the cession of Alta California, New Mexico, and <a class="link" href="./Baja_California_Peninsula">Baja California</a>, recognition of the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas, and American access across the <a class="link" href="./Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Trist was authorized to make a payment of up to $30 million in exchange for these concessions.</span> <span class="sentence">In August 1847, as he advanced towards Mexico City, Scott defeated Santa Anna at the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Contreras">Battle of Contreras</a> and the <a class="link" href="./Battle_of_Churubusco">Battle of Churubusco</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">With the Americans at the gates of Mexico City, Trist negotiated with commissioners, but the Mexicans were willing to give up little.</span> <span class="sentence">Scott prepared <a class="link" href="./Battle_for_Mexico_City">to take Mexico City</a>, which he did in mid-September.</span> <span class="sentence">In the United States, a heated political debate emerged regarding how much of Mexico the United States should seek to annex, Whigs such as Henry Clay arguing that the United States should only seek to settle the Texas border question, and some expansionists arguing for the <a class="link" href="./All_of_Mexico_Movement">annexation of all of Mexico</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">War opponents were also active; Whig Congressman <a class="link" href="./Abraham_Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> of Illinois introduced the "exact spot" resolutions, calling on Polk to state exactly where American blood had been shed on American soil to start the war, but the House refused to consider them.</span>

  <div class="text">
    <span class="sentence">Frustrated by a lack of progress in negotiations, Polk ordered Trist to return to Washington, but the diplomat, when the notice of recall arrived in mid-November 1847, decided to remain, writing a lengthy letter to Polk the following month to justify his decision.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk considered having Butler, designated as Scott's replacement, forcibly remove him from Mexico City.</span> <span class="sentence">Though outraged by Trist's decision, Polk decided to allow him some time to negotiate a treaty.</span> <span class="sentence">Throughout January 1848, Trist regularly met with officials in Mexico City, though at the request of the Mexicans, the treaty signing took place in Guadalupe Hidalgo, a small town near Mexico City.</span> <span class="sentence">Trist was willing to allow Mexico to keep Baja California, as his instructions allowed, but successfully haggled for the inclusion of the important harbor of <a class="link" href="./San_Diego">San Diego</a> in a cession of Alta California.</span> <span class="sentence">Provisions included the Rio Grande border and a $15 million payment to Mexico.</span> <span class="sentence">On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican delegation signed the <a class="link" href="./Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk received the document on February 19, and, after the Cabinet met on the 20th, decided he had no choice but to accept it. If he turned it down, with the House by then controlled by the Whigs, there was no assurance Congress would vote funding to continue the war.</span> <span class="sentence">Both Buchanan and Walker dissented, wanting more land from Mexico, a position with which the President was sympathetic, though he considered Buchanan's view motivated by his ambition.</span> <span class="sentence">Some senators opposed the treaty because they wanted to take no Mexican territory; others hesitated because of the irregular nature of Trist's negotiations.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk waited in suspense for two weeks as the Senate considered it, sometimes hearing that it would likely be defeated, and that Buchanan and Walker were working against it. He was relieved when the two Cabinet officers lobbied on behalf of the treaty.</span> <span class="sentence">On March 10, the Senate ratified the treaty in a 38–14 vote, on a vote that cut across partisan and geographic lines.</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate made some modifications to the treaty before ratification, and Polk worried that the Mexican government would reject them.</span> <span class="sentence">On June 7, Polk learned that Mexico had ratified the treaty.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk declared the treaty in effect as of July 4, 1848, thus ending the war.</span> <span class="sentence">With the acquisition of California, Polk had accomplished all four of his major presidential goals.</span> <span class="sentence">With the exception of the territory acquired by the 1853 <a class="link" href="./Gadsden_Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a>, the territorial acquisitions under Polk established the modern borders of the <a class="link" href="./Contiguous_United_States">Contiguous United States</a>.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Polk had been anxious to establish a territorial government for Oregon once the treaty was effective in 1846, but the matter became embroiled in the arguments over slavery, though few thought Oregon suitable for that institution.</span> <span class="sentence">A bill to establish an Oregon territorial government passed the House after being amended to bar slavery; the bill died in the Senate when opponents ran out the clock on the congressional session.</span> <span class="sentence">A resurrected bill, still barring slavery, again passed the House in January 1847 but it was not considered by the Senate before Congress adjourned in March.</span> <span class="sentence">By the time Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his annual message urged the establishment of territorial governments in all three.</span> <span class="sentence">The <a class="link" href="./Missouri_Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the <a class="link" href="./Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36°30′ latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory.</span> <span class="sentence">If extended to the Pacific, this would have made slavery illegal in San Francisco, but allowed it in Monterey and Los Angeles.</span> <span class="sentence">A plan to accomplish the extension was defeated in the House by a bipartisan alliance of Northerners.</span> <span class="sentence">As the last congressional session before the 1848 election came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the <a class="link" href="./Oregon_Territory">Territory of Oregon</a> and prohibited slavery in it. When Congress reconvened in December 1848, Polk asked it in his annual message to establish territorial governments in California and New Mexico, a task made especially urgent by the onset of the <a class="link" href="./California_Gold_Rush">California Gold Rush</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation, though congressional action continued until the final hours of Polk's term.</span> <span class="sentence">When the bill was amended to have the laws of Mexico apply to the southwest territories until Congress changed them (thus effectively banning slavery), Polk made it clear that he would veto it, considering it the Wilmot Proviso in another guise.</span> <span class="sentence">It was not until the <a class="link" href="./Compromise_of_1850">Compromise of 1850</a> that the matter of the territories was resolved.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Congress passed the <a class="link" href="./Rivers_and_Harbors_Bill">Rivers and Harbors Bill</a> in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve port facilities, but Polk vetoed it. Polk believed that the bill was unconstitutional because it unfairly favored particular areas, including ports that had no foreign trade.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk considered internal improvements to be matters for the states, and feared that passing the bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home district—a type of <a class="link" href="./Political_corruption">corruption</a> that he felt would spell doom to the <a class="link" href="./Republicanism_in_the_United_States">virtue of the republic</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In this regard he followed his hero Jackson, who had vetoed the <a class="link" href="./Maysville_Road_veto">Maysville Road Bill</a> in 1830 on similar grounds.</span> <span class="sentence">Opposed by conviction to Federal funding for internal improvements, Polk stood strongly against all such bills.</span> <span class="sentence">Congress, in 1847, passed another internal improvements bill; he <a class="link" href="./Pocket_veto">pocket veto</a>ed it and sent Congress a full veto message when it met in December.</span> <span class="sentence">Similar bills continued to advance in Congress in 1848, though none reached his desk.</span> <span class="sentence">When he came to the Capitol to sign bills on March 3, 1849, the last day of the congressional session and his final full day in office, he feared that an internal improvements bill would pass Congress, and he brought with him a draft veto message.</span> <span class="sentence">The bill did not pass, so it was not needed, but feeling the draft had been ably written, he had it preserved among his papers.</span> <span class="sentence">Authoritative word of the discovery of gold in California did not arrive in Washington until after the 1848 election, by which time Polk was a <a class="link" href="./Lame_duck_(politics)">lame duck</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's political adversaries had claimed California was too far away to be useful, and was not worth the price paid to Mexico.</span> <span class="sentence">The President was delighted by the news, seeing it as validation of his stance on expansion, and referred to the discovery several times in his final annual message to Congress that December.</span> <span class="sentence">Shortly thereafter, actual samples of the California gold arrived, and Polk sent a special message to Congress on the subject.</span> <span class="sentence">The message, confirming less authoritative reports, caused large numbers of people to move to California, both from the U.S. and abroad, thus helping to spark the <a class="link" href="./California_Gold_Rush">California Gold Rush</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">One of Polk's last acts as President was to sign the bill creating the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Department_of_the_Interior">Department of the Interior</a> (March 3, 1849).</span> <span class="sentence">This was the first new cabinet position created since the early days of the Republic.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto, or to draft a sufficient veto message, so he signed the bill.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Polk was a slaveholder for most of his adult life.</span> <span class="sentence">His father, Samuel Polk, in 1827 left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32 km²) of land, and divided about 53 slaves among his widow and children in his will.</span> <span class="sentence">James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, either directly or from deceased brothers.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear <a class="link" href="./Plantations_in_the_American_South">plantation</a> land that his father had left him near <a class="link" href="./Somerville,_Tennessee">Somerville, Tennessee</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7 km²) of land, a cotton plantation near <a class="link" href="./Coffeeville,_Mississippi">Coffeeville, Mississippi</a>, hoping to increase his income.</span> <span class="sentence">The land in Mississippi was richer than that in Somerville, and Polk transferred his Tennessee slaves there, taking care to conceal from them that they were to be sent south.</span> <span class="sentence">From the start of 1839, Polk, having bought out his brother-in-law, owned all of the Mississippi plantation, and ran it on a mostly absentee basis for the rest of his life.</span> <span class="sentence">He occasionally visited —for example, he spent much of April 1844 on his Mississippi plantation, right before the Democratic convention.</span> <span class="sentence">Adding to the inherited slaves, in 1831, Polk purchased five more, mostly buying them in Kentucky, and expending $1,870; the youngest had a recorded age of 11. As older children sold for a higher price, slave sellers routinely lied about age.</span> <span class="sentence">Between 1834 and 1835, he bought five more, aged from 2 to 37, the youngest a granddaughter of the oldest.</span> <span class="sentence">The amount expended was $2,250.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1839, he bought eight slaves from his brother William at a cost of $5,600.</span> <span class="sentence">This represented three young adults and most of a family, though not including the father, whom James Polk had previously owned, and who had been sold to a slave trader as a chronic runaway.</span> <span class="sentence">The expenses of four campaigns (three for governor, one for the presidency) in six years kept Polk from making more slave purchases until after he was living in the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">In an era when the presidential salary was expected to cover wages for the White House servants, Polk replaced them with slaves from his home in Tennessee.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk did not purchase slaves with his presidential salary, likely for political reasons.</span> <span class="sentence">Instead, he reinvested earnings from his plantation in the purchase of slaves, enjoining secrecy on his agent: "that as my <i>private business</i> does not concern the public, you will keep it to yourself".</span> <span class="sentence">Polk saw the plantation as his route to a comfortable existence after his presidency for himself and his wife; he did not intend to return to the practice of law.</span> <span class="sentence">Hoping the increased labor force would increase his retirement income, he purchased seven slaves in 1846, through an agent, aged roughly between 12 and 17. The 17 year old and one of the 12 year olds were purchased together at an <a class="link" href="./Estate_sale">estate sale</a>; the agent within weeks resold the younger boy to Polk's profit.</span> <span class="sentence">The year 1847 saw the purchase of nine more.</span> <span class="sentence">Three he purchased from Gideon Pillow, and his agent purchased six slaves, aged between 10 and 20. By the time of the purchase from Pillow, the Mexican War had begun and Polk sent payment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army.</span> <span class="sentence">The purchase from Pillow was a slave Polk had previously owned and had sold for being a disruption, and his wife and child.</span> <span class="sentence">None of the other slaves Polk purchased as President, all younger than 20, came with a parent, and as only in the one case were two slaves bought together, most likely none had an accompanying sibling as each faced life on Polk's plantation.</span> <span class="sentence">Discipline for those owned by Polk varied over time.</span> <span class="sentence">At the Tennessee plantation, he employed an <a class="link" href="./Plantations_in_the_American_South#Overseer">overseer</a> named Herbert Biles, who was said to be relatively indulgent.</span> <span class="sentence">Biles's illness in 1833 resulted in Polk replacing him with Ephraim Beanland, who tightened discipline and increased work.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk backed his overseer, returning runaways who complained of beatings and other harsh treatment, "even though every report suggested that the overseer was a heartless brute".</span> <span class="sentence">Beanland was hired for the Mississippi plantation, but was soon dismissed by Polk's partner, who deemed Beanland too harsh as the slaves undertook the arduous task of clearing the timber from the new plantation so it could be used for cotton farming.</span> <span class="sentence">His replacement was discharged after a year for being too indulgent; the next died of dysentery in 1839.</span> <span class="sentence">Others followed, and it was not until 1845 that Polk found a satisfactory overseer, John Mairs, who remained the rest of Polk's life and was still working at the plantation for Sarah Polk in 1860, when the widow sold a half-share in many of her slaves.</span> <span class="sentence">There had been a constant stream of runaways under Mairs' predecessors, many seeking protection at the plantation of Polk relatives or friends; only one ran away between the time of Mairs' hiring and the end of 1847, but the overseer had to report three absconded slaves (including the one who had fled earlier) to Polk in 1848 and 1849.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk's will, dated February 28, 1849, a few days before the end of his presidency, contained the nonbinding expectation that his slaves were to be freed when both he and Sarah Polk were dead.</span> <span class="sentence">The Mississippi plantation was expected to be the support of Sarah Polk during her widowhood.</span> <span class="sentence">Sarah Polk lived until 1891, but the slaves were freed in 1865 by the <a class="link" href="./Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>, which abolished slavery in the United States.</span> <span class="sentence">By selling a half-interest in the slaves in 1860, Sarah Polk had given up the sole power to free them, and it is unlikely that her new partner, having paid $28,500 for a half-interest in the plantation and its slaves, would have allowed the laborers to go free had she died while slavery was legal.</span> <span class="sentence">Like Jackson, Polk saw the politics of slavery as a side issue compared to more important matters such as territorial expansion and economic policy.</span> <span class="sentence">The issue of slavery became increasingly polarizing during the 1840s, and Polk's expansionary policies increased its divisiveness.</span> <span class="sentence">During his presidency, many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the "<a class="link" href="./Slave_Power">Slave Power</a>", and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported <a class="link" href="./Texas_Annexation">annexing Texas</a> and later <a class="link" href="./Mexican–American_War">war with Mexico</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk did support the expansion of slavery's realm, with his views informed by his own family's experience of settling Tennessee, bringing slaves with them.</span> <span class="sentence">He believed in Southern rights, meaning both the right of slave states not to have that institution interfered with by the Federal government, and the right of individual Southerners to bring their slaves with them into the new territory.</span> <span class="sentence">Though Polk opposed the Wilmot Proviso, he also condemned southern agitation on the issue, and he accused both northern and southern leaders of attempting to use the slavery issue for political gain.</span> <span class="sentence">On March 4, 2017, new tombstones for three of his slaves, Elias Polk, Mary Polk and Matilda Polk, were placed in the <a class="link" href="./Nashville_City_Cemetery">Nashville City Cemetery</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Elias and Mary Polk both survived slavery, dying in the 1880s; Matilda Polk died still in slavery in 1849, at the age of about 110.</span>

    <span class="sentence">After his death, Polk's historic reputation was initially formed by the attacks made on him in his own time.</span> <span class="sentence">Whig politicians claimed that he was drawn from a well-deserved obscurity.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Sam_Houston">Sam Houston</a> is said to have observed that Polk, a teetotaler, was "a victim of the use of water as a beverage".</span> <span class="sentence">Little was published about him but two biographies released in the wake of his death.</span> <span class="sentence">Polk was not again the subject of a major biography until 1922, when Eugene I. McCormac published <i>James K. Polk: A Political Biography</i>.</span> <span class="sentence">McCormac relied heavily on Polk's presidential diary, first published in 1909.</span> <span class="sentence">When historians began ranking the presidents in 1948, Polk ranked 10th in <a class="link" href="./Arthur_M._Schlesinger_Sr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.'s</a> poll, and has subsequently ranked 8th in Schlesinger's 1962 poll, 11th in the Riders-McIver Poll (1996), and 14th in the 2017 survey by <a class="link" href="./C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Borneman deemed Polk the most effective president prior to the Civil War, and noted that Polk expanded the power of the presidency, especially in its power as commander in chief and its oversight over the Executive Branch.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Steven_G._Calabresi">Steven G. Calabresi</a> and <a class="link" href="./Christopher_S._Yoo">Christopher S. Yoo</a>, in their history of presidential power, praised Polk's conduct of the Mexican War, "it seems unquestionable that his management of state affairs during this conflict was one of the strongest examples since Jackson of the use of presidential power to direct specifically the conduct of subordinate officers."</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Harry_S._Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> called Polk "a great president. Said what he intended to do and did it."</span> <span class="sentence">Bergeron noted that the matters that Polk settled, he settled for his time.</span> <span class="sentence">The questions of the banking system, and of the tariff, which Polk had made two of the main issues of his presidency, were not significantly revised until the 1860s.</span> <span class="sentence">Similarly, the Gadsden Purchase, and <a class="link" href="./Alaska_Purchase">that of Alaska</a> (1867), were the only major U.S. expansions until the 1890s.</span> <span class="sentence">Paul H. Bergeron wrote in his study of Polk's presidency: "Virtually everyone remembers Polk and his expansionist successes. He produced a new map of the United States, which fulfilled a continent-wide vision."</span> <span class="sentence">"To look at that map," <a class="link" href="./Robert_W._Merry">Robert W. Merry</a> concluded, "and to take in the western and southwestern expanse included in it, is to see the magnitude of Polk's presidential accomplishments."</span> <span class="sentence">Amy Greenberg, in her history of the Mexican War, found Polk's legacy to be more than territorial, "during a single brilliant term, he accomplished a feat that earlier presidents would have considered impossible. With the help of his wife, Sarah, he masterminded, provoked and successfully prosecuted a war that turned the United States into a world power."</span> <span class="sentence">Borneman noted that in securing this expansion, Polk did not consider the likely effect on Mexicans and Native Americans, "That ignorance may well be debated on moral grounds, but it cannot take away Polk's stunning political achievement."</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./James_A._Rawley">James A. Rawley</a> wrote in his <a class="link" href="./American_National_Biography"><i>American National Biography</i></a> piece on Polk, "he added extensive territory to the United States, including Upper California and its valuable ports, and bequeathed a legacy of a nation poised on the Pacific rim prepared to emerge as a superpower in future generations".</span> <span class="sentence">Historians have criticized Polk for not perceiving that his territorial gains set the table for civil war.</span> <span class="sentence">Pletcher stated that Polk, like others of his time, failed "to understand that sectionalism and expansion had formed a new, explosive compound".</span> <span class="sentence">Fred I. Greenstein, in his journal article on Polk, noted that Polk "lacked a far-seeing awareness of the problems that were bound to arise over the status of slavery in the territory acquired from Mexico" William Dusinberre, in his volume on Polk as slave owner, suggested "that Polk's deep personal involvement in the plantation slavery system ... colored his stance on slavery-related issues".</span> <span class="sentence">Greenberg noted that Polk's war served as the training ground for that later conflict:</span>
