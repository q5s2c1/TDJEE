He implemented <a class="link" href="./Zero-based_budgeting">zero-based budgeting</a> within state departments and added a Judicial Selection Commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor.</span> <span class="sentence">The reorganization plan was submitted in January 1972, but had a cool reception in the legislature.</span> <span class="sentence">But after two weeks of negotiations, it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session.</span> <span class="sentence">Ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 22—a fact he would emphasize in his presidential run—although it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so. In an April 3, 1971 televised appearance, when asked if he was in favor of a requirement that candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Georgia would have to run on the same ticket, Carter said, "I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia.
