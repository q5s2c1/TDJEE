a trusted advisor, to remain.</span> <span class="sentence">In early 1963, Kennedy related to Martin Luther King, Jr., his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: "If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill."</span> <span class="sentence">Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year.</span> <span class="sentence">Brother Robert and Ted Sorenson pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front.</span> <span class="sentence">On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor <a class="link" href="./George_Wallace">George Wallace</a> blocked the <a class="link" href="./Stand_in_the_Schoolhouse_Door">doorway</a> to the <a class="link"

href="./United_States_National_Guard">U.S. National Guard</a>, which had just been federalized by order of the president.</span> <span class="sentence">That evening Kennedy gave his famous <a

legislationâ€”to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.</span> <span class="sentence">His proposals became part of the <a class="link" href="./Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The day ended with the murder of a NAACP leader, <a class="link" href="./Medgar_Evers">Medgar Evers</a>, in front of his home in Mississippi.</span> <span class="sentence">As the president had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans.</span> <span class="sentence">When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complemented Kennedy on his remarks, the latter bitterly replied, "Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House."</span> <span class="sentence">He then added, "But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did."</span> <span class="sentence">On June 16, <a class="link" href="./The_New_York_Times"><i>The New York Times</i></a> published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially "moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment" in regards to civil rights he "now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life."</span> <span class="sentence">Earlier, Kennedy had signed the executive order creating the <a class="link" href="./Presidential_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women">Presidential Commission on the Status of Women</a> on December 14, 1961.</span> <span class="sentence">Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission.</span> <span class="sentence">The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; its final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in October 1963.</span> <span class="sentence">Further, on June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the <a class="link" href="./Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963">Equal Pay Act of 1963</a>, which amendEd the <a class="link" href="./Fair_Labor_Standards_Act">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> and abolished wage disparity based on sex.</span> <span class="sentence">Over a hundred thousand, predominantly African Americans gathered in Washington for the civil rights <a class="link" href="./March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> on August 28, 1963.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak.</span> <span class="sentence">He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the N.A.A.C.P. and Martin Luther King's <a class="link" href="./Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC).</span> <span class="sentence">To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00 pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed.</span> <span class="sentence">The March was considered a "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred.</span> <span class="sentence">Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.</span> <span class="sentence">Nevertheless, the struggle was far from over.</span> <span class="sentence">Three weeks later, <a class="link" href="./16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing">a bomb exploded</a> on Sunday, September 15, at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.</span> <span class="sentence">Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.</span> <span class="sentence">Gaining Republican support, Senator <a class="link" href="./Everett_Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a> promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a <a class="link" href="./Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate">Senate filibuster</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The legislation was enacted by Kennedy's successor President Lyndon B.

    <span class="sentence">The <a class="link" href="./Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)">US Special Forces</a> had a special bond with Kennedy.</span> <span class="sentence">"It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret," said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the US military newspaper <a class="link" href="./Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)"><i>Stars and Stripes</i></a> who served with Special Forces in Vietnam.</span> <span class="sentence">This bond was shown at <a class="link" href="./State_funeral_of_John_F._Kennedy">Kennedy's funeral</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General <a class="link" href="./Michael_D._Healy">Michael D. Healy</a>, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington Cemetery.</span> <span class="sentence">Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. Navy, and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another <a class="link" href="./Special_forces">special forces</a> command, the <a class="link" href="./United_States_Navy_SEALs">Navy SEALs</a>, which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</span> <span class="sentence">President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory.</span> <span class="sentence">President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964.</span> <span class="sentence">This civil rights law ended what was known as the "<a class="link" href="./Solid_South">Solid South</a>" and certain provisions were modeled after the <a class="link" href="./Civil_Rights_Act_of_1875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>, signed into law by President <a class="link" href="./Ulysses_S._Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy's continuation of Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson's escalation of the conflict.</span> <span class="sentence">At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived.</span> <span class="sentence">His agreement to the NSAM 263 action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech at American University, suggest that he was ready to end the Vietnam War.</span> <span class="sentence">The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.</span> <span class="sentence">Many of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as Abraham Lincoln, <a class="link" href="./George_Washington">George Washington</a>, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.</span> <span class="sentence">Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington.</span> <span class="sentence">In 2018, <a class="link" href="./The_Times"><i>The Times</i></a> published an audio recreation of the "watchmen on the walls of world freedom" speech he was scheduled to deliver at the <a class="link" href="./Dallas_Market_Center">Dallas Trade Mart</a> on November 22, 1963.</span> <span class="sentence">He was posthumously awarded the <i>Pacem in Terris</i> Award (<a class="link" href="./Latin">Latin</a>: Peace on Earth).</span> <span class="sentence">It was named after a 1963 <a class="link" href="./Encyclical">encyclical</a> letter by <a class="link" href="./Pope_John_XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations.</span> <span class="sentence">Kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father.</span> <span class="sentence">He is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent.</span> <span class="sentence">His maternal grandmother, Mary Josephine "Josie" Hannon, died in August 1964, nine months after his assassination.</span> <span class="sentence">Throughout the <a class="link" href="./English-speaking_world">English-speaking world</a>, the given name <a class="link" href="./Kennedy_(given_name)"><i>Kennedy</i></a> has sometimes been used in honor of President Kennedy, as well his brother Robert.</span>

  <div class="text">
    <span class="sentence">Television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination.</span> <span class="sentence">In fact, television started to come of age before the assassination.</span> <span class="sentence">On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with <a class="link" href="./CBS_Evening_News"><i>CBS Evening News</i></a> anchor <a class="link" href="./Walter_Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information.</span> <span class="sentence">In this sense his assassination was the first major TV news event of its kind.</span> <span class="sentence">TV coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time.</span> <span class="sentence">All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.</span> <span class="sentence">The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the U.S. but around the world.</span> <span class="sentence">Many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japanese <a class="link" href="./Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941, before it and the <a class="link" href="./September_11_attacks">September 11 attacks</a> after it. UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination: "all of us..... will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours."</span> <span class="sentence">Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially the Vietnam War.</span> <span class="sentence">Ultimately, the death of President Kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishmentâ€”a point made by commentators from <a class="link" href="./Gore_Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> to Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. and implied by <a class="link" href="./Oliver_Stone">Oliver Stone</a> in several of his films, such as his landmark 1991 <i>JFK</i>.</span>
