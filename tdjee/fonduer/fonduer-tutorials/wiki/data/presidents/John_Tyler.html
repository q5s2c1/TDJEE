    <span class="sentence">Tyler's presidency has provoked highly divided responses among political commentators.</span> <span class="sentence">It is generally held in low esteem by historians; Edward P. Crapol began his biography <i>John Tyler, the Accidental President</i> (2006) by noting: "Other biographers and historians have argued that John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed."</span> <span class="sentence">In <i>The Republican Vision of John Tyler</i> (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency "is generally ranked as one of the least successful".</span> <span class="sentence">Seager wrote that Tyler "was neither a great president nor a great intellectual," adding that despite a few achievements, "his administration has been and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment".</span> <span class="sentence">A survey of historians conducted by <a class="link" href="./C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> in 2017 ranked Tyler as 39th of 43 men to hold the office.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler's assumption of complete presidential powers "set a hugely important precedent", according to a biographical sketch by the <a class="link" href="./University_of_Virginia">University of Virginia's</a> <a class="link" href="./Miller_Center_of_Public_Affairs">Miller Center of Public Affairs</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler's successful insistence that he was president, and not a caretaker or acting president, was a model for the succession of seven other presidents over the 19th and 20th centuries.</span> <span class="sentence">The propriety of Tyler's action in assuming both the title of the presidency and its full powers was legally affirmed in 1967, when it was codified in the <a class="link" href="./Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Some scholars in recent years have praised Tyler's foreign policy.</span> <span class="sentence">Monroe credits him with "achievements like the Webster–Ashburton treaty which heralded the prospect of improved relations with Great Britain, and the annexation of Texas, which added millions of acres to the national domain."</span> <span class="sentence">Crapol argued that Tyler "was a stronger and more effective president than generally remembered", while Seager wrote, "I find him to be a courageous, principled man, a fair and honest fighter for his beliefs. He was a president without a party."</span> <span class="sentence">Author <a class="link" href="./Ivan_Eland">Ivan Eland</a>, in an update of his 2008 book <i>Recarving Rushmore</i>, rated all 44 US presidents by the criteria of peace, prosperity, and liberty; with the finished ratings, John Tyler was ranked the best president of all time.</span> <span class="sentence">Louis Kleber, in his article in <a class="link" href="./History_Today"><i>History Today</i></a>, pointed out that Tyler brought integrity to the White House at a time when many in politics lacked it, and refused to compromise his principles to avoid the anger of his opponents.</span> <span class="sentence">Crapol argues that Tyler's allegiance to the Confederacy overshadows much of the good he did as president: "John Tyler's historical reputation has yet to fully recover from that tragic decision to betray his loyalty and commitment to what he had once defined as 'the first great American interest'—the preservation of the Union."</span> <span class="sentence">Norma Lois Peterson, in her book on Tyler's presidency, suggested that Tyler's general lack of success as president was due to external factors that would have affected whoever was in the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">Chief among them was Henry Clay, who was determined to realize <a class="link" href="./American_System_(economic_plan)">the vision he had for America</a>, and who would brook no opposition.</span> <span class="sentence">In the aftermath of Jackson's determined use of the powers of the Executive Branch, the Whigs wanted the president to be dominated by Congress, and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate.</span> <span class="sentence">Tyler resented this, leading to the conflict between the branches that dominated his presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Pointing to Tyler's advances in foreign policy, she deemed Tyler's presidency "flawed ... but ... not a failure".</span> <span class="sentence">While academics have both praised and criticized Tyler, the general American public has little awareness of him at all.</span> <span class="sentence">Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation's most obscure presidents.</span> <span class="sentence">As Seager remarked: "His countrymen generally remember him, if they have heard of him at all, as the <a class="link" href="./Tippecanoe_and_Tyler_Too">rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan</a>."</span>
