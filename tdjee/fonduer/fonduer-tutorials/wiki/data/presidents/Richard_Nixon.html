What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation."</span> <span class="sentence">Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's Congressional career, suggests that "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy".</span> <span class="sentence">Aitken feels that "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible."</span> <span class="sentence">Some historians say Nixon's <a class="link" href="./Southern_Strategy">Southern Strategy</a> made the South a Republican stronghold, while others deem economic factors more important in the change.</span> <span class="sentence">Throughout his career, Nixon moved his party away from the control of isolationists, and as a Congressman he was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism.</span> <span class="sentence">According to his biographer Herbert Parmet, "Nixon's role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course, somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers, the Goldwaters, and the Reagans."</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon's stance on domestic affairs has been credited with the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation.</span> <span class="sentence">In a 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, historian Paul Charles Milazzo points to Nixon's creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 <a class="link" href="./Endangered_Species_Act">Endangered Species Act</a>, stating that "though unsought and unacknowledged, Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure".</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon himself did not consider the environmental advances he made in office an important part of his legacy; some historians contend that his choices were driven more by political expediency than any strong environmentalism.</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon saw his policies on Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as central to his place in history.</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon's onetime opponent <a class="link" href="./George_McGovern">George McGovern</a> commented in 1983, "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II [...] With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history."</span> <span class="sentence">Political scientist <a class="link" href="./Jussi_Hanhimäki">Jussi Hanhimäki</a> disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of <a class="link" href="./Containment">containment</a> by diplomatic rather than military means.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Christopher_Andrew_(historian)">Christopher Andrew</a> concludes that "Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena.

He clung to the idea of being 'tough'.</span> <span class="sentence">He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness.</span> <span class="sentence">But that was what betrayed him.</span> <span class="sentence">He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president.</span> <span class="sentence">Even Bebe Rebozo, by some accounts his closest friend, did not call him by his first name.</span> <span class="sentence">Nixon stated of this,</span> <span class="sentence">Even with close friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding this and that and the other thing—saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep' ... I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself.</span> <span class="sentence">That's just the way I am. Some people are different.</span> <span class="sentence">Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts ... [and] reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed.</span> <span class="sentence">Not me. No way.</span> <span class="sentence">When told that most Americans, even at the end of his career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know."</span>
