    <span class="sentence">In the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams by 71–68 and was elected vice president because of a mistake in voting for Adams's running mate.</span> <span class="sentence">As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an "honorable and easy" role.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him unusually well qualified to serve as presiding officer.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as <a class="link" href="./Jefferson's_Manual"><i>A Manual of Parliamentary Practice</i></a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson held four confidential talks with French consul Joseph Létombe in the spring of 1797 where he attacked Adams, predicting that his rival would serve only one term.</span> <span class="sentence">He also encouraged France to invade England, and advised Létombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing him to "listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings."</span> <span class="sentence">This toughened the tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams administration.</span> <span class="sentence">After Adams's initial peace envoys were rebuffed, Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident, called the <a class="link" href="./XYZ_Affair">XYZ Affair</a> after the letters used to disguise the identities of the French officials involved.</span> <span class="sentence">However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against France.</span> <span class="sentence">The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France known as the <a class="link" href="./Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">During the Adams presidency, the Federalists rebuilt the military, levied new taxes, and enacted the <a class="link" href="./Alien_and_Sedition_Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson believed that these laws were intended to suppress Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and considered them unconstitutional.</span> <span class="sentence">To rally opposition, he and James Madison anonymously wrote the <a class="link" href="./Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a>, declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states.</span> <span class="sentence">The resolutions followed the "<a class="link" href="./Interposition">interposition</a>" approach of Madison, in which states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson advocated <a class="link" href="./Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)">nullification</a>, allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien and Sedition Acts would "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood".</span> <span class="sentence">Historian <a class="link" href="./Ron_Chernow">Ron Chernow</a> claims that "the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion", contributing to the <a class="link" href="./American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a> as well as later events.</span> <span class="sentence">Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that, if "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", the resolutions would "dissolve the union or produce coercion."</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson and Madison moved to Philadelphia and founded the <a class="link" href="./National_Gazette">National Gazette</a> in 1791, along with poet and writer <a class="link" href="./Phillip_Freneau">Phillip Freneau</a>, in an effort to counter Hamilton's Federalist policies, which Hamilton was promoting through the influential Federalist newspaper the <a class="link" href="./Gazette_of_the_United_States">Gazette of the United States</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The National Gazette made particular criticism of the policies promoted by Alexander Hamilton, often through anonymous essays signed by the pen name <i>Brutus</i> at Jefferson's urging, which were actually written by Madison.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson had always admired Washington's leadership skills but felt that his Federalist party was leading the country in the wrong direction.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson thought it wise not to attend his funeral in 1799 because of acute differences with Washington while serving as Secretary of State, and remained at Monticello.</span>

    <span class="sentence">In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson contended once more against Federalist John Adams.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams's campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War.</span> <span class="sentence">Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was "one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history".</span> <span class="sentence">Republicans ultimately won more electoral college votes, but Jefferson and his vice presidential candidate <a class="link" href="./Aaron_Burr">Aaron Burr</a> unexpectedly received an equal total.</span> <span class="sentence">Due to the tie, the election was decided by the Federalist-dominated House of Representatives.</span> <span class="sentence">Hamilton lobbied Federalist representatives on Jefferson's behalf, believing him a lesser political evil than Burr.</span> <span class="sentence">On February 17, 1801, after thirty-six ballots, the House elected Jefferson president and Burr vice president.</span> <span class="sentence">The win was marked by Republican celebrations throughout the country.</span> <span class="sentence">Some of Jefferson's opponents argued that he owed his victory over Adams to the South's inflated number of electors, due to counting slaves as partial population under the <a class="link" href="./Three-Fifths_Compromise">Three-Fifths Compromise</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Others alleged that Jefferson secured <a class="link" href="./James_A._Bayard_(elder)">James Asheton Bayard's</a> tie-breaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the retention of various Federalist posts in the government.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson disputed the allegation, and the historical record is inconclusive.</span> <span class="sentence">The transition proceeded smoothly, marking a watershed in American history.</span> <span class="sentence">As historian <a class="link" href="./Gordon_S._Wood">Gordon S.

  <div class="text">
    <span class="sentence">Jefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops.</span> <span class="sentence">He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when he counted 41. Over his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves; he inherited about 175 while most of the remainder were born on his plantations.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson purchased slaves in order to unite their families, and he sold about 110 for economic reasons, primarily slaves from his outlying farms.</span> <span class="sentence">Many historians have described Jefferson as a benevolent slaveowner who didn't overwork his slaves by the conventions of his time, and provided them log cabins with fireplaces, food, clothing and some household provisions, though slaves often had to make many of their own provisions.</span> <span class="sentence">Additionally, Jefferson gave his slaves financial and other incentives while also allowing them to grow gardens and raise their own chickens.</span> <span class="sentence">The whip was employed only in rare and extreme cases of fighting and stealing.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson once said, "My first wish is that the labourers may be well treated".</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson did not work his slaves on Sundays and Christmas and he allowed them more personal time during the winter months.</span> <span class="sentence">Some scholars doubt Jefferson's benevolence, however, noting cases of excessive slave whippings in his absence.</span> <span class="sentence">His nail factory was only staffed by child slaves, but many of those boys became tradesmen.</span> <span class="sentence">Burwell Colbert, who started his working life as a child in Monticello's Nailery, was later promoted to the supervisory position of butler.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master, but had reservations about releasing unprepared slaves into freedom and advocated gradual emancipation.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1779, he proposed gradual voluntary training and resettlement to the Virginia legislature, and three years later drafted legislation allowing owners to free their own slaves.</span> <span class="sentence">In his draft of the Declaration of Independence, he included a section, stricken by other Southern delegates, criticizing King George III's role in promoting slavery in the colonies.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1784, Jefferson proposed the abolition of slavery in all western U.S. territories, limiting slave importation to 15 years.</span> <span class="sentence">Congress, however, failed to pass his proposal by one vote.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, a partial victory for Jefferson that terminated slavery in the Northwest Territory.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson freed his slave Robert Hemings in 1794 and he freed his cook slave James Hemings in 1796.</span> <span class="sentence">During his presidency Jefferson allowed the diffusion of slavery into the <a class="link" href="./Louisiana_Territory">Louisiana Territory</a> hoping to prevent slave uprisings in Virginia and to prevent <a class="link" href="./South_Carolina">South Carolina</a> secession.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1804, in a compromise on the slavery issue, Jefferson and Congress banned domestic slave trafficking for one year into the Louisiana Territory.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1806 he officially called for anti-slavery legislation terminating the import or export of slaves.</span> <span class="sentence">Congress passed the law in 1807, taking effect in 1818.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1819, he strongly opposed a Missouri statehood application amendment that banned domestic slave importation and freed slaves at the age of 25 on grounds it would destroy the union.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson freed his runaway slave <a class="link" href="./Harriet_Hemings">Harriet Hemings</a> in 1822.</span> <span class="sentence">Upon his death in 1826, Jefferson freed five male Hemings slaves in his will.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson shared the common belief of his day that blacks were mentally and physically inferior, but argued they nonetheless had innate human rights.</span> <span class="sentence">In <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, he created controversy by calling slavery a moral evil for which the nation would ultimately have to account to God.</span> <span class="sentence">He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as <a class="link" href="./Liberia">Liberia</a> or <a class="link" href="./Sierra_Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals.</span> <span class="sentence">During his presidency Jefferson was for the most part publicly silent on the issue of slavery and emancipation, as the Congressional debate over slavery and its extension caused a dangerous north-south rift among the states, with talk of a northern confederacy in New England.</span> <span class="sentence">The violent attacks on white slave owners during the <a class="link" href="./Haitian_Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a> due to injustices under slavery supported Jefferson's fears of a race war, increasing his reservations about promoting emancipation at that time.</span> <span class="sentence">After numerous attempts and failures to bring about emancipation, Jefferson wrote privately in an 1805 letter to <a class="link" href="./William_A._Burwell">William A. Burwell</a>, "I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the extinguishment of slavery among us."</span> <span class="sentence">That same year he also related this idea to <a class="link" href="./George_Logan">George Logan</a>, writing, "I have most carefully avoided every public act or manifestation on that subject."</span>

Wilson</a>, and others, maintains Jefferson was an opponent of slavery all his life, noting that he did what he could within the limited range of options available to him to undermine it, his many attempts at abolition legislation, the manner in which he provided for slaves, and his advocacy of their more humane treatment.</span> <span class="sentence">The revisionist view, advanced by <a class="link" href="./Paul_Finkelman">Paul Finkelman</a> and others, criticizes Jefferson for racism, for holding slaves, and for acting contrary to his words.</span> <span class="sentence">Jefferson never freed most of his slaves, and he remained silent on the issue while he was president.</span> <span class="sentence">Contextualists such as <a class="link" href="./Joseph_J._Ellis">Joseph J.
