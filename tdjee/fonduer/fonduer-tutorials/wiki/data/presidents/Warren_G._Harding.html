Harding had asked Willis to place his name in nomination, and the former governor responded with a speech popular among the delegates, both for its folksiness and for its brevity in the intense Chicago heat.</span> <span class="sentence">Reporter Mark Sullivan, who was present, called it a splendid combination of "oratory, grand opera, and <a class="link" href="./Hog_calling">hog calling</a>."</span> <span class="sentence">Willis confided, leaning over the podium railing, "Say, boys—and girls too—why not name Warren Harding?"</span> <span class="sentence">The laughter and applause that followed created a warm feeling for Harding.</span> <span class="sentence">Four ballots were taken on the afternoon of June 11, and they revealed a deadlock.</span> <span class="sentence">With 493 votes needed to nominate, Wood was the closest with 3141/2; Lowdon had 2891/2.</span> <span class="sentence">The best Harding had done was 651/2.</span> <span class="sentence">Chairman <a class="link" href="./Henry_Cabot_Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> of Massachusetts, the <a class="link" href="./Senate_Majority_Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a>, adjourned the convention about 7 p.m.</span> <span class="sentence">The night of June 11–12, 1920, would become famous in political history as the night of the "<a class="link" href="./Smoke-filled_room">smoke-filled room</a>," in which, legend has it, party elders agreed to force the convention to nominate Harding.</span> <span class="sentence">Historians have focused on the talks held in the suite of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman <a class="link" href="./Will_H._Hays">Will Hays</a> at the <a class="link" href="./Blackstone_Hotel">Blackstone Hotel</a>, at which senators and others came and went, and numerous possible candidates were discussed.</span> <span class="sentence">Utah Senator <a class="link" href="./Reed_Smoot">Reed Smoot</a>, before his departure early in the evening, backed Harding, telling Hays and the others that as the Democrats were likely to nominate Governor Cox, they should pick Harding to win Ohio.</span> <span class="sentence">Smoot also told <a class="link" href="./The_New_York_Times"><i>The New York Times</i></a> that there had been an agreement to nominate Harding, but that it would not be done for several ballots yet.</span> <span class="sentence">This was not true: a number of participants backed Harding (others supported his rivals), but there was no pact to nominate him, and the senators had little power to enforce any agreement.</span> <span class="sentence">Two other participants in the smoke-filled room discussions, Kansas Senator <a class="link" href="./Charles_Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> and Colonel <a class="link" href="./George_Brinton_McClellan_Harvey">George Brinton McClellan Harvey</a>, a close friend of Hays, predicted to the press that Harding would be nominated because of the liabilities of the other candidates.</span> <span class="sentence">Colonel Harvey's account of the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for in the early morning hours, to be informed by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate.</span> <span class="sentence">Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not.</span> <span class="sentence">Harding biographer Charles W.

You cannot defeat this man!"</span> <span class="sentence">Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee, a scheme Hays refused to have anything to do with.</span> <span class="sentence">The ninth ballot, after some initial suspense, saw delegation after delegation break for Harding, who took the lead with 3741/2 votes to 249 for Wood and 1211/2 for Lowden (Johnson had 83).</span> <span class="sentence">Lowden released his delegates to Harding, and the tenth ballot, held at 6 p.m., was a mere formality, with Harding finishing with 6721/5 votes to 156 for Wood.</span> <span class="sentence">The nomination was made unanimous.</span> <span class="sentence">The delegates, desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses, then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination.</span> <span class="sentence">Harding wanted Senator <a class="link" href="./Irvine_Lenroot">Irvine Lenroot</a> of Wisconsin, who was unwilling to run, but before Lenroot's name could be withdrawn and another candidate decided on, an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge, which was met with a roar of approval from the delegates.</span> <span class="sentence">Coolidge, popular for his role in breaking the <a class="link" href="./Boston_Police_Strike">Boston police strike</a> of 1919, was nominated for vice president, receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had.</span> <span class="sentence">James Morgan wrote in <a class="link" href="./The_Boston_Globe"><i>The Boston Globe</i></a>: "The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday ... the President makers did not have a clean shirt.

    <span class="sentence">Upon his death, Harding was deeply mourned.</span> <span class="sentence">He was called a man of peace in many European newspapers; American journalists praised him lavishly, with some describing him as having given his life for his country.</span> <span class="sentence">His associates were stunned by his demise; Daugherty wrote, "I can hardly write about it or allow myself to think about it yet."</span> <span class="sentence">Hughes stated, "I cannot realize that our beloved Chief is no longer with us."</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./Hagiography">Hagiographic</a> accounts of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's <i>Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President</i> (1924).</span> <span class="sentence">By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration soon became a byword for corruption in the view of the public.</span> <span class="sentence">Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: <i>Masks in a Pageant</i>, by <a class="link" href="./William_Allen_White">William Allen White</a>, mocked and dismissed Harding, as did <a class="link" href="./Samuel_Hopkins_Adams">Samuel Hopkins Adams</a>' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, <i>Revelry</i>.</span> <span class="sentence">These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness.</span> <span class="sentence">The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem.</span> <span class="sentence">President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb.</span> <span class="sentence">Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931.</span> <span class="sentence">By that time, with the <a class="link" href="./Great_Depression">Great Depression</a> in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.</span> <span class="sentence">Adams continued to shape the negative view of Harding with several nonfiction works in the 1930s, culminating with <i>The Incredible Era—The Life and Times of Warren G. Harding</i> (1939) in which he called his subject "an amiable, well-meaning third-rate <a class="link" href="./Babbitt_(novel)">Mr. Babbitt</a>, with the equipment of a small-town semi-educated journalist ... It could not work. It did not work."</span> <span class="sentence">Dean deems the works of White and Adams "remarkably unbalanced and unfair accounts, exaggerating the negative, assigning responsibility to Harding for all wrongs, and denying him credit for anything done right. Today there is considerable evidence refuting their portrayals of Harding. Yet the myth has persisted."</span> <span class="sentence">The opening of Harding's papers for research in 1964 sparked a small spate of biographies, of which the most controversial was Russell's <i>The Shadow of Blooming Grove</i> (1968), which concluded that the rumors of black ancestry (the "shadow" of the title) deeply affected Harding in his formative years, causing both Harding's conservatism and his desire to get along with everyone.</span> <span class="sentence">Coffey faults Russell's methods, and deems the biography "largely critical, though not entirely unsympathetic."</span> <span class="sentence">Murray's <i>The Harding Era</i> (1969) took a more positive view of the president, and put him in the context of his times.</span> <span class="sentence">Trani and Wilson faulted Murray for "a tendency to go overboard" in trying to connect Harding with the successful policies of cabinet officers, and for asserting, without sufficient evidence, that a new, more assertive Harding had emerged by 1923.</span> <span class="sentence">Later decades saw revisionist books published on Harding.</span> <span class="sentence">Robert Ferrell's <i>The Strange Deaths of President Harding</i> (1996), according to Coffey, "spends almost the entire work challenging every story about Harding and concludes that almost everything that is read and taught about his subject is wrong."</span> <span class="sentence">In 2004, John Dean, noted for his involvement in another presidential scandal, <a class="link" href="./Watergate_scandal">Watergate</a>, wrote the Harding volume in "The American Presidents" series of short biographies, edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Coffey deemed that book the most revisionist to date, and faults Dean for glossing over some unfavorable episodes in Harding's life, like his silence during the 1914 Senate campaign, when his opponent Hogan was being attacked for his faith.</span> <span class="sentence">Harding has traditionally been <a class="link" href="./Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States">ranked as one of the worst presidents</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In a 1948 poll conducted by <a class="link" href="./Harvard_University">Harvard University</a>, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. conducted the first notable survey of scholars' opinions of the presidents, Harding ranked last among the 29 presidents considered.</span> <span class="sentence">He has also been last in other polls since, which Ferrell attributes to scholars reading little but sensational accounts of Harding.</span> <span class="sentence">Murray argued that Harding deserves more credit than historians have given: "He was certainly the equal of a <a class="link" href="./Franklin_Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, an <a class="link" href="./Andrew_Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, a <a class="link" href="./Benjamin_Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, or even a Calvin Coolidge. In concrete accomplishments, his administration was superior to a sizable portion of those in the nation's history."</span> <span class="sentence">Coffey believes "the academic lack of interest in Harding has cost him his reputation, as scholars still rank Harding as nearly dead last among presidents."</span> <span class="sentence">Trani faults Harding's own lack of depth and decisiveness as bringing about his tarnished legacy.</span> <span class="sentence">Still, modern authors and historians continue to call for a reconsideration of Harding's presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Murray argued that Harding sowed the seeds for his administration's poor standing:</span>
