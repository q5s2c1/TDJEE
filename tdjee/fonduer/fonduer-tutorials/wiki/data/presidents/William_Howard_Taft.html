    <span class="sentence">During the 1920 election campaign, Taft supported the Republican ticket, Harding (by then a senator) and Massachusetts Governor <a class="link" href="./Calvin_Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>; they were elected.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft was among those asked to come to the <a class="link" href="./President-elect_of_the_United_States">president-elect's</a> <a class="link" href="./Warren_G._Harding_House">home</a> in <a class="link" href="./Marion,_Ohio">Marion, Ohio</a> to advise him on appointments, and the two men conferred there on December 24, 1920.</span> <span class="sentence">By Taft's later account, after some conversation, Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court; if Taft would, Harding would appoint him.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft had a condition for Harding—having served as president, and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis, he could accept only the chief justice position.</span> <span class="sentence">Harding made no response, and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House.</span> <span class="sentence">In January 1921, Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him, if given the chance.</span> <span class="sentence">White by then was in failing health, but made no move to resign when Harding was sworn in on March 4, 1921.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft called on the chief justice on March 26, and found White ill, but still carrying on his work and not talking of retiring.</span> <span class="sentence">White did not retire, dying in office on May 19, 1921.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft issued a tribute to the man he had appointed to the center seat, and waited and worried if he would be White's successor.</span> <span class="sentence">Despite widespread speculation Taft would be the pick, Harding made no quick announcement.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft was lobbying for himself behind the scenes, especially with <a class="link" href="./Ohio_Gang">the Ohio politicians</a> who formed Harding's inner circle.</span> <span class="sentence">It later emerged that Harding had also promised former Utah senator <a class="link" href="./George_Sutherland">George Sutherland</a> a seat on the Supreme Court, and was waiting in the expectation that another place would become vacant.</span> <span class="sentence">Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice <a class="link" href="./William_R._Day">William R. Day</a> to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim.</span> <span class="sentence">After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General <a class="link" href="./Harry_Daugherty">Harry Daugherty</a>, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921.</span> <span class="sentence">The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in <a class="link" href="./Executive_session">executive session</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat.</span> <span class="sentence">When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Taft is remembered as the heaviest president; he was 5 ft tall and his weight peaked at 335 - 340 lb toward the end of his presidency, though this later decreased, and by 1929 he weighed just 244 lb. By the time Taft became chief justice, his health was starting to decline, and he carefully planned a fitness regimen, walking 3 mile from his home to the Capitol each day.</span> <span class="sentence">When he also walked home after work, he would usually go by way of <a class="link" href="./Connecticut_Avenue">Connecticut Avenue</a> and use a particular crossing over <a class="link" href="./Rock_Creek_(Potomac_River)">Rock Creek</a>; after his death the crossing was named the <a class="link" href="./Taft_Bridge">Taft Bridge</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">At <a class="link" href="./Inauguration_of_Herbert_Hoover">Hoover's inauguration</a> on March 4, 1929, Taft recited part of the oath incorrectly, later writing, "my memory is not always accurate and one sometimes becomes a little uncertain", misquoting again in that letter, differently.</span> <span class="sentence">His health gradually declined over the near-decade of his chief justiceship, and he wrote in 1929, "I am older and slower and less acute and more confused. However, as long as things continue as they are, and I am able to answer to my place, I must stay on the court in order to prevent the Bolsheviki from getting control".</span> <span class="sentence">Taft insisted on going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles, who died on December 31, 1929; the strain did not improve his own health.</span> <span class="sentence">When the court reconvened on January 6, 1930, Taft had not returned to Washington, and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but had been unable to complete because of his illness.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft went to <a class="link" href="./Asheville,_North_Carolina">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, for a rest, but by the end of January, he could barely speak and was suffering from hallucinations.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice.</span> <span class="sentence">Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices.</span> <span class="sentence">He died at his home in Washington on March 8, 1930.</span> <span class="sentence">Three days following his death, on March 11, he became the first president and first member of the Supreme Court to be buried at <a class="link" href="./Arlington_National_Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./James_Earle_Fraser_(sculptor)">James Earle Fraser</a> sculpted his grave marker out of <a class="link" href="./Stony_Creek_(Branford)">Stony Creek</a> granite.</span>

    <span class="sentence">Lurie argued that Taft did not receive the public credit for his policies that he should have.</span> <span class="sentence">Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt (although the lawsuits received much publicity).</span> <span class="sentence">Taft, more quietly than his predecessor, filed many more cases than did Roosevelt, and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was such a thing as a "good" trust.</span> <span class="sentence">This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency; according to Lurie, Taft "was boring—honest, likable, but boring".</span> <span class="sentence">Scott Bomboy for the <a class="link" href="./National_Constitution_Center">National Constitution Center</a> wrote that despite being "one of the most interesting, intellectual, and versatile presidents ... a chief justice of the United States, a wrestler at Yale, a reformer, a peace activist, and a baseball fan  ... today, Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub," a story that is not true.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft similarly remains known for another physical characteristic—as the last <a class="link" href="./List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_with_facial_hair">president with facial hair</a> to date.</span> <span class="sentence">Mason called Taft's years in the White House "undistinguished".</span> <span class="sentence">Coletta deemed Taft to have had a solid record of bills passed by Congress, but felt he could have accomplished more with political skill.</span> <span class="sentence">Anderson noted that Taft's prepresidential federal service was entirely in appointed posts, and that he had never run for an important executive or legislative position, which would have allowed him to develop the skills to manipulate public opinion, "the presidency is no place for on-the-job training".</span> <span class="sentence">According to Coletta, "in troubled times in which the people demanded progressive change, he saw the existing order as good."</span> <span class="sentence">Inevitably linked with Roosevelt, Taft generally falls in the shadow of the flamboyant <a class="link" href="./Rough_Rider">Rough Rider</a>, who chose him to be president, and who took it away.</span> <span class="sentence">Yet, a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete: as Coletta put it, "Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him?"</span> <span class="sentence">Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not, Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft was generally slow to act, and when he did, his actions often generated enemies, as in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair.</span> <span class="sentence">Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters, and, with no comment from the White House, hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent.</span> <span class="sentence">And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a <a class="link" href="./James_Buchanan">Buchanan</a>-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good.</span> <span class="sentence">Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's <i>Autobiography</i> (which placed this view in enduring form) was published after both men had left the presidency (in 1913), was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party, and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor.</span> <span class="sentence">While Roosevelt was biased, he was not alone: every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft was convinced he would be vindicated by history.</span> <span class="sentence">After he left office, he was estimated to be about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict.</span> <span class="sentence">Coletta noted that this places Taft in good company, with <a class="link" href="./James_Madison">James Madison</a>, <a class="link" href="./John_Quincy_Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> and McKinley.</span> <span class="sentence">Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Gould, "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party."</span> <span class="sentence">Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history".</span> <span class="sentence">Taft has been rated among the greatest of the chief justices; later Supreme Court Justice <a class="link" href="./Antonin_Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a> noted that this was "not so much on the basis of his opinions, perhaps because many of them ran counter to the ultimate sweep of history".</span> <span class="sentence">A successor as chief justice, <a class="link" href="./Earl_Warren">Earl Warren</a>, concurred: "In Taft's case, the symbol, the tag, the label usually attached to him is 'conservative.' It is certainly not of itself a term of opprobrium even when bandied by the critics, but its use is too often confused with 'reactionary.' " Most commentators agree that as chief justice, Taft's most significant contribution was his advocacy for reform of the high court, urging and ultimately gaining improvement in the court's procedures and facilities.</span> <span class="sentence">Mason cited enactment of the Judges' Bill of 1925 as Taft's major achievement on the court.</span> <span class="sentence">According to Anderson, Taft as chief justice "was as aggressive in the pursuit of his agenda in the judicial realm as Theodore Roosevelt was in the presidential".</span> <span class="sentence">The house in Cincinnati where Taft was born and lived as a boy is now the <a class="link" href="./William_Howard_Taft_National_Historic_Site">William Howard Taft National Historic Site</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Taft's son <a class="link" href="./Robert_A._Taft">Robert</a> was a significant political figure, becoming <a class="link" href="./Senate_Majority_Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a> and three times a major contender for the Republican nomination for president.</span> <span class="sentence">A conservative, each time he was defeated by a candidate backed by the more liberal <a class="link" href="./Eastern_Establishment">Eastern Establishment</a> wing of the party.</span> <span class="sentence">Lurie concluded his account of William Taft's career,</span>
