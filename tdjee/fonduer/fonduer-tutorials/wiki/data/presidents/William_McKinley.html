    <span class="sentence">It is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president.</span> <span class="sentence">As Phillips notes, "no documents, no diaries, no confidential letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems."</span> <span class="sentence">From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, "what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House."</span> <span class="sentence">Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.</span> <span class="sentence">Backed by Hanna's money and organizational skills, McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896.</span> <span class="sentence">When other contenders such as Speaker Reed and <a class="link" href="./Iowa">Iowa</a> Senator <a class="link" href="./William_B._Allison">William B. Allison</a> sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies, they found that Hanna's agents had preceded them.</span> <span class="sentence">According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election,</span> <span class="sentence">Hanna, on McKinley's behalf, met with the eastern Republican <a class="link" href="./Political_boss">political boss</a>es, such as Senators <a class="link" href="./Thomas_C._Platt">Thomas Platt</a> of New York and <a class="link" href="./Matthew_Quay">Matthew Quay</a> of Pennsylvania, who were willing to guarantee McKinley's nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices.</span> <span class="sentence">McKinley, however, was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals, and Hanna accepted that decision.</span> <span class="sentence">Many of their early efforts were focused on the South; Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region.</span> <span class="sentence">McKinley needed 453½ delegate votes to gain the nomination; he gained nearly half that number from the South and <a class="link" href="./Border_states_(American_Civil_War)">border states</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Platt lamented in his memoirs, "[Hanna] had the South practically solid before some of us awakened."</span> <span class="sentence">The bosses still hoped to deny McKinley a first-ballot majority at <a class="link" href="./1896_Republican_National_Convention">the convention</a> by boosting support for local <a class="link" href="./Favorite_son">favorite son</a> candidates such as Quay, New York Governor (and former vice president) <a class="link" href="./Levi_P._Morton">Levi P. Morton</a>, and Illinois Senator <a class="link" href="./Shelby_Cullom">Shelby Cullom</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Delegate-rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground, as McKinley supporters, such as Chicago businessman (and future vice president) <a class="link" href="./Charles_G._Dawes">Charles G. Dawes</a>, sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St. Louis.</span> <span class="sentence">Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines; at the state convention at the end of April, McKinley completed a near-sweep of Illinois' delegates.</span> <span class="sentence">Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race; when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination, the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly.</span> <span class="sentence">Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley.</span> <span class="sentence">Wyoming Senator <a class="link" href="./Francis_Warren">Francis Warren</a> wrote, "The politicians are making a hard fight against him, but if the masses could speak, McKinley is the choice of at least 75% of the entire [body of] Republican voters in the Union".</span> <span class="sentence">By the time the national convention began in <a class="link" href="./St._Louis">St. Louis</a> on June 16, 1896, McKinley had an ample majority of delegates.</span> <span class="sentence">The former governor, who remained in Canton, followed events at the convention closely by telephone, and was able to hear part of Foraker's speech nominating him over the line.</span> <span class="sentence">When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states, its votes gave McKinley the nomination, which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house, anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidate's home.</span> <span class="sentence">Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch.</span> <span class="sentence">The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman <a class="link" href="./Garret_Hobart">Garret Hobart</a> of New Jersey for vice president, a choice actually made, by most accounts, by Hanna.</span> <span class="sentence">Hobart, a wealthy lawyer, businessman, and former state legislator, was not widely known, but as Hanna biographer <a class="link" href="./Herbert_Croly">Herbert Croly</a> pointed out, "if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it".</span>

    <span class="sentence">Before the Republican convention, McKinley had been a "straddle bug" on the currency question, favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing <a class="link" href="./Bimetallism">bimetallism</a> by international agreement.</span> <span class="sentence">In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for <a class="link" href="./Bimetallism">bimetallism</a> by international agreement.</span> <span class="sentence">Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator <a class="link" href="./Henry_M._Teller">Henry M. Teller</a>, to walk out of the convention.</span> <span class="sentence">However, compared with the Democrats, Republican divisions on the issue were small, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates.</span> <span class="sentence">The bad economic times had continued, and strengthened the hand of forces for <a class="link" href="./Free_silver">free silver</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West.</span> <span class="sentence">The silverites took control of the <a class="link" href="./1896_Democratic_National_Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a> and chose <a class="link" href="./William_Jennings_Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> for president; he had electrified the delegates with his <a class="link" href="./Cross_of_Gold_speech">Cross of Gold speech</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy.</span> <span class="sentence">Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election, and they gave $3.5 million for speakers and over 200 million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.</span> <span class="sentence"><a class="link" href="./William_Jennings_Bryan_presidential_campaign,_1896">Bryan's campaign</a> had at most an estimated $500,000.</span> <span class="sentence">With his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in the race, Bryan decided on a <a class="link" href="./Whistle_stop_train_tour">whistle-stop</a> political tour by train on an unprecedented scale.</span> <span class="sentence">Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour with one of his own; the candidate declined on the grounds that the Democrat was a better stump speaker: "I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to <i>think</i> when I speak."</span> <span class="sentence">Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's '<a class="link" href="./Front_porch_campaign">Front Porch Campaign</a>' became a legend in American political history."</span> <span class="sentence">McKinley made himself available to the public every day except Sunday, receiving delegations from the front porch of his home.</span> <span class="sentence">The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates—the pro-silver Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i> disgustedly stated that going to Canton had been made "cheaper than staying at home".</span> <span class="sentence">Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinley's home on North Market Street.</span> <span class="sentence">Once there, they crowded close to the front porch—from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs—as their spokesman addressed McKinley.</span> <span class="sentence">The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation.</span> <span class="sentence">The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesman's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative.</span> <span class="sentence">This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him, as <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1884#Campaign">had happened to Blaine in 1884</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Most Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan, the major exception being the New York <i>Journal</i>, controlled by <a class="link" href="./William_Randolph_Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, whose fortune was based on silver mines.</span> <span class="sentence">In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of <a class="link" href="./Homer_Davenport">Homer Davenport</a>, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor.</span> <span class="sentence">McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by big business.</span> <span class="sentence">Even today, these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk.</span> <span class="sentence">The Democrats had pamphlets too, though not as many.</span> <span class="sentence">Jones analyzed how voters responded to the education campaigns of the two parties:</span> <span class="sentence">The battleground proved to be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states.</span> <span class="sentence">The Northeast was considered most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and <a class="link" href="./Vermont">Vermont</a> supported him in September.</span> <span class="sentence">By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue.</span> <span class="sentence">By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question.</span> <span class="sentence">On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say.</span> <span class="sentence">McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the <a class="link" href="./Electoral_College_(United_States)">Electoral College</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers.</span> <span class="sentence">Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was <a class="link" href="./Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado.</span> <span class="sentence">The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a <a class="link" href="./Realigning_election">realigning election</a>, in which McKinley's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed.</span> <span class="sentence">The voting patterns established then displaced the near-deadlock the major parties had seen since the Civil War; the Republican dominance begun then would continue <a class="link" href="./United_States_presidential_election,_1932">until 1932</a>, another realigning election with the ascent of <a class="link" href="./Franklin_Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Phillips argues that, with the possible exception of Iowa Senator Allison, McKinley was the only Republican who could have defeated Bryan—he theorized that eastern candidates such as Morton or Reed would have done badly against the Illinois-born Bryan in the crucial Midwest.</span> <span class="sentence">According to the biographer, though Bryan was popular among rural voters, "McKinley appealed to a very different industrialized, urbanized America."</span>

    <span class="sentence">According to Gould, "The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley's passing."</span> <span class="sentence">The stock market, faced with sudden uncertainty, suffered a steep decline—almost unnoticed in the mourning.</span> <span class="sentence">The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train, first to Washington, where it first lay in the <a class="link" href="./East_Room">East Room</a> of the Executive Mansion, and then in state in the Capitol, and then was taken to Canton.</span> <span class="sentence">A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the <a class="link" href="./Capitol_Rotunda">Capitol Rotunda</a>, many having waited hours in the rain; in Canton, an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18. The following day, a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house, where relatives paid their final respects.</span> <span class="sentence">It was then transported to the receiving vault at <a class="link" href="./West_Lawn_Cemetery">West Lawn Cemetery</a> in Canton, to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned.</span> <span class="sentence">There was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, that they should be prepared for a double funeral.</span> <span class="sentence">This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train.</span> <span class="sentence">Leech noted "the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love".</span> <span class="sentence">She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street.</span> <span class="sentence">She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907.</span> <span class="sentence">She died only months before the completion of <a class="link" href="./McKinley_National_Memorial">the large marble monument</a> to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907.</span> <span class="sentence">William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.</span>

    <span class="sentence">In addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley.</span> <span class="sentence">There is the <a class="link" href="./William_McKinley_Monument"><i>William McKinley Monument</i></a> in front of the <a class="link" href="./Ohio_Statehouse">Ohio Statehouse</a> in Columbus, Ohio and <a class="link" href="./National_McKinley_Birthplace_Memorial">a monument at his birthplace</a> in Niles; 20 Ohio schools bear his name.</span> <span class="sentence">There are several schools in the United States named <a class="link" href="./McKinley_School_(disambiguation)">McKinley School</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death.</span> <span class="sentence">Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents.</span> <span class="sentence">Statues to him may be found in more than a dozen states; his name has been bestowed on streets, civic organizations, and libraries.</span> <span class="sentence">McKinley's name is also used in the large inner-city Honolulu, Hawaii high school, <a class="link" href="./President_William_McKinley_High_School">President William McKinley High School</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1896, a gold prospector gave McKinley's name to <a class="link" href="./Denali">Denali</a>, the tallest mountain in North America at 20310 ft.

    <span class="sentence">McKinley's biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history.</span> <span class="sentence">However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor's death.</span> <span class="sentence">The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations.</span> <span class="sentence">Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 1920, according to Gould, McKinley's administration was deemed no more than "a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt's".</span> <span class="sentence">Beginning in the 1950s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland.</span> <span class="sentence">Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley's presidency profoundly affected the nation's future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinley's standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency.</span> <span class="sentence">There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley's election was at the time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the <a class="link" href="./Third_Party_System">Third</a> and <a class="link" href="./Fourth_Party_System">Fourth Party System</a>s.</span> <span class="sentence">Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley.</span> <span class="sentence">Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people.</span> <span class="sentence">Republican <a class="link" href="./Karl_Rove">Karl Rove</a> exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s—a realignment that did not happen.</span> <span class="sentence">Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</span> <span class="sentence">Phillips writes that McKinley's low rating is undeserved, and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln.</span> <span class="sentence">He pointed to McKinley's success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation.</span> <span class="sentence">Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death.</span> <span class="sentence">These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under <a class="link" href="./Calvin_Coolidge">Coolidge</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, whom Roosevelt elevated to the <a class="link" href="./Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">Supreme Court</a> where he remained nearly twenty years, and <a class="link" href="./William_Howard_Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, whom McKinley had made <a class="link" href="./Governor-General_of_the_Philippines">Governor-General of the Philippines</a> and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.</span> <span class="sentence">A controversial aspect of McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley.</span> <span class="sentence">The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of <a class="link" href="./American_imperialism">American empire</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.</span> <span class="sentence">Morgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades:</span>
